#NAME?,EP 6 Uttarkashi to Gangotri Dham | Uttarakhand Tourist places,"visa2explore

This is Day 6 of our 30 day Uttarakhand Tour. In this episode you will see Sukhi Top, Harsil, Mukhba village and many other places of tourist interest.

We also got opportunity to explore taste of mountains, we stopped on the route to enjoy local food of hills. When you will travel on this route you will notice mind blowing scenic views, you should definitely keep buffer time to stop at these place and take some  pics for memory of lifetime.

Journey from Uttarakashi to Harsil is packed with natural beauty of hills.
Biometric regitration: During the whole journey, no one checked our Bio metric registration. As understood by me, there are 2 reasons or need for biometric registration on the yatra route.
1st-  It gives a rough estimate to government about how many people are there on the yatra route at any point of time. Though there is no entry gate or exit gate to check whether you have done it or not. They capture information like for how many days you are travelling and ofcourse your address details with id.

2nd reason - In an unlikely scenario, like the Kedarnath Dham 2013 incident where many people died because of natural calamilty, government would know the names and addresses of people who were there during the yatra route. This may not be 100 correct, unless they check it at entry and exit points of each Dham but still it will provide reasonable data. Something is better than nothing.

If you know of any 3rd reason for this, Do share the same in comment in this video.

Following are the details  of places visited by us during this Day 6 tour.

Khedi Waterfall : This waterfall can be best enjoyed between June to Aug ie during rainy season but i will not  suggest you to travel to hills during this time as its not safe, there may be landslides during this  period.

Address: River Bhagirathi, Uttarakhand

Gulmarg is so beautiful! But one thing that people don't know about is that visiting Gulmarg, Kashmir is even possible over a slightly longer weekend if you have a Friday off. And it is a very accessible place if you take a flight to Srinagar. One of the highlights of the place is that it is a very developed winter destination for pursuing sports like Skiing and Snowboarding. 

Having said that, I feel like Kashmir is also a very safe place for tourism and one must visit without any doubts that you will have a wonderful experience because of the warm and welcoming locals.

I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.

// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?

Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.

// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel Blogging

My advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.

// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time Blogger

Setting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:

Pick your domain name

Welcome to Kausani which has been called as 'The Switzerland of India' by Mahatma Gandhi. Today, I left from Ranikhet and reached Kausani. It was 2 hours of journey and I paid INR 1,800 to the taxi driver for this. Kausani is a very famous hill station in Almora district, part of it also belongs to Bageshwar district in Uttrakhand. This famous hill station of Uttrakhand has countless things to offer to its visitors. It's full of history, tea garden, handloom factory, temples and not to mention the breathtaking view of the Himalayas including Trishul Peak, Nanda Devi Peak and Panchachuli peaks. 

I have chosen to stay at a homestay in Kausani which is not just wonderful but in budget too. A room here will cost you INR 3,000/da including meals or you can even book the entire property (7 rooms) for 10,000/day. The price of the property rental may vary depending upon the season and availability. You can contact them:

LFuNMxU3cDM,10 Best Travel Channels on YouTube to follow & travel virtually (my personal favorites),"BackPacker Steve
93.3K subscribers

Exploring foreign countries with their diverse nature and culture isn’t always possible. In this video I want to share a list of my 10 favorite travel channels on YouTube with you!

Exploring foreign countries with their diverse nature and culture isn’t always possible - for different reasons. During those times I love watching travel videos - to prepare for an upcoming trip, to get inspired or to simply travel virtually to places far away. 

Over the past few years I started following different travel related channels on Youtube and even got the chance to work together with some fellow content creators on some of my own trips. While some channels stopped producing content or decided to head into a different direction over time, others stood out and kept inspiring me with their quality content on a regular base.

I came up with this list of the 10 best travel travel channels on Youtube to follow.

Following you can find all of the channels I featured in this video:

1.93K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
In today's video I interview 4 successful travel bloggers who have set up niche travel sites and ask them about how to monetize a niche travel blog in 2020.

Some of these bloggers have one main niche site, where as the others have 2 or even 3 successful niche travel blogs and are happy to share all their unique blog monetization strategies.

From display ads to affiliate marketing, itinerary planning, selling custom tours, paid campaigns with tourism boards, selling their own books and online products to advising fellow members of the tourism sector on marketing strategies - these ladies are absolute PROS.

I actually did 5 interviews, and have decided to split them all into 2 videos instead of one. This one is about monetization strategies and tomorrows video will be about how to initially launch a niche site, what to focus on, how to find your goal and tips for beginners.

It would be great if we could chase our dreams without any outside input. But for some reason, there is always input. Sometimes it’s life-giving, like receiving the well-timed encouragement of a friend (or stranger) at exactly the same moment you were thinking about giving up. But other times, it’s crushing.

But does that mean we should change our dreams? Or worse, stop chasing them at all? 

Watch what happened when Gloria Atanmo dared to chase a dream beyond expectations.

What are the top restaurants in Trivandrum? Well, it's tough to answer that question. First of all, I have not visited all the restaurants in Trivandrum yet. Even if I had been to all the food spots in Thiruvananthapuram, if I select 10 restaurants from them, it would only be my selected 10 restaurants in Thiruvananthapuram. Though I gave the title like Top 10 Restaurants in Trivandrum and thumbnail caption as 10 Best Restaurants in Trivandrum, this video will only be my favorite 10 food spots in and around the capital city of Kerala. 
I had been to over 50 food spots in Thiruvananthapuram out of which around 30 were shot into videos. There are many more restaurants in the city to be visited and explored. Yes, if you can suggest some of the best restaurants in and around the city or even the rural areas of Trivandrum, that could be worth visiting and suggest others to visit, you can always mention them in the comments below.
The list of our selected 10 Trivandrum based restaurants are as below:

In 2013, Barry Diller, in partnership with Hudson River Park Trust leadership, embarked on the unique opportunity to envision a solution for the repair and reactivation of Pier 54, recently damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Diller chose to reimagine an entirely new type of public space for New York, one that would create an immersive experience with nature and art.
Rising from the remnants of Pier 54, Little Island sits on a site that has played a pivotal role in the story of the Hudson River and its surrounding communities. Every visit to Little Island is a reminder of the dynamic evolution of New York City's waterfront.

Travel video about destination Alaska.
Alaska is a country situated on the edge of the Arctic and dream destination for wildlife and nature lovers who answer to the call of the wild.  A land of bears, glaciers, pioneers and prospectors on the northern tip of the American continent. In Vancouver, Canada’s pearl of the Pacific Ocean, begins an extraordinary journey along the Alexander Archipelago in the Gulf Of Alaska, a charming capital with European flair.  In English Bay a giant metal crab guards the planetarium and by aquabus our journey travels across False Creek to Science World with its marvellous glass globe that contains a museum of modern art. Ketchikan is a small town located five hundred and twenty six nautical miles north of Vancouver and was founded by the Tlingit Indians.  In the 1880’s the town based its economy on salmon and timber but today relies upon tourism. Since 1900, Juneau has been the capital city of Alaska, the forty ninth state of the U.S.A.  In 1880, Joe Juneau, Richard Harris and their Tlingit Indian leader, Chief Kowee, discovered gold in Gold Creek and the gold rush began. Glacier Bay was completely covered by ice and glaciers around four thousand years ago during the Little Ice Age.  The ice melted and the ever-changing glaciers are today situated within the arms of the bay which stretches almost a hundred kilometres to the north. Barrow is the northernmost point of inhabited North America and five hundred kilometres north of the Arctic Circle.  The living conditions in the arctic wastelands are extremely harsh and most of the year it is bone-chillingly cold. Even today the promise of untamed nature and boundless freedom attracts us to America’s final wilderness.  Alaska is full of wild extremes and stark contrasts, a fascinating land of pure adventure!

As an artist I used to travel around so many cities. Few months before I went to Nepal for my first ever International Jam, It was my first experience outside India. I got to learn a lot from there & had an great experience, also I'm in semifinals of popping all styles 7 to smoke.
Our country won in each category which is a matter of pride for us.

Suddenly I thought of sharing my experience to you all, so all I have is some clips & made this short blog just for you to know my 1st experience out side India.

My name is Avelovinit and I am a full-time female travel vlogger! 

I have been a digital nomad since 2017 so I realized, why not share a day in a life of a full-time travel vlogger?! It's nice to let you guys see what a day in my life looks like. Being a digital nomad can be fun but at the same time, there are moments that other people doesn't see. A lot of hard work and dedication is definitely the key! I know a lot of full time bloggers and most of my days are kind of similar to them (unless they are really popular youtubers/bloggers/instagrammers. I am a one man team mostly but I do have managers that help me with answering my emails and inquiries :) 

I hope you guys enjoy this short video I made and inspire you to try solo travel and also get some travel tips from me! I would appreciate if you guys can comment if you want be to do daily vlogs or what kind of videos you want me to film next; whether it's backpacking tips, how to's, packing tips, budget travel tips or simply how to start vlogging? :)

There is so much to experience in Incredible India that one life time is just not enough. No wonder we Indians believe in reincarnation so that we can visit India again and again to cherish the billion things India has to offer from the Great Himalayas to the beaches of Goa and the Colors of Rajasthan to the fragrance of spices in Gods own country Kerala. 
Come and join me to watch the incredible India in most cinematic way.

7jCE2Zaz0fA,"Alaska to Vancouver, A Road Trip Timelapse","007craft
70.6K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
So the story here is that back in 2012 I went on a roadtrip up to Alaska with a friend of mine.  The 6 days up were so great that we thought it would be cool to get a timelapse of the trip back.  

I bought my very first goPro while up there, the hero2 at the time, and setup a rig on my windsheild using the suction cup mount and some duct tape (We couldnt find the skeleton housing in stores and needed an open case to charge the camera as it recorded).   The goal was to capture the essence of the complete route and make it more enjoyable than most of the bad footage you see elsewhere on youtube.  It was filmed in 1080p, 60fps and we tried our best to drive during daylight and wash the windows to keep the view clear.  Theres virtually no cuts while driving during the entire film, so you get the actual full trip experience.  To do this we used a system of 2 memory cards and swapped them quickly at stops when they filled up, while moving the footage over to a laptop from the full card as we drove.  

There was actually quite a bit of planning into how we did everything from filming and framing shots, to constantly passing other vehicles to make it feel more surreal and to keep the view in front of us clear. I kinda sat on the 60 hours of 150, unorganized files for 5 years because the task of editing it all into something watchable was so daunting but I finally managed to get it done.  Ive added in pictures from the trip at relevant parts, along with locations of all the pit stops and some areas along the way with an included map (This was hard to edit in as the hero2 had no GPS funcationaliy). Footage is sped up 30 times for the most part, jumping up even faster to skip over traffic and pit stops while being slowed down for all the wildlife and interesting parts.  The footage contained mostly radio music and personal conversation so I stripped it all and added in some filler music the best I could (Its hard to find good music which you can use in your youtube videos without copyright infringment).  However the video is setup so that once I stop talking at the beggining, everything is explained with text prompts so you can mute the video and play your own music in the background if you wish. 

I hope you all enjoy and get the feel of doing the actual trip yourself from this.  If youre lazy however and just want to see the highlights, I have an index here you can click through to jump to the interesting parts, but youll miss lots of cool scenery.  Cheers!

In 2013, Barry Diller, in partnership with Hudson River Park Trust leadership, embarked on the unique opportunity to envision a solution for the repair and reactivation of Pier 54, recently damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Diller chose to reimagine an entirely new type of public space for New York, one that would create an immersive experience with nature and art.
Rising from the remnants of Pier 54, Little Island sits on a site that has played a pivotal role in the story of the Hudson River and its surrounding communities. Every visit to Little Island is a reminder of the dynamic evolution of New York City's waterfront.

In the first half of this video we will be sampling our local Louisiana farm food with blood oranges the Louisiana strawberry and Cajun boiled peanuts.  In second half of the episode we will see the citrus groves full of Louisiana fruit as we shop at another location of Becnel’s Farmer’s Market that is at their farm.  After purchasing our farmers market fruit and vegetable selection we will be sampling the home grown Louisiana sweet potato, Louisiana pecans, the Louisiana satsuma (which is our version of a mandarin orange) and more Cajun spicy boiled peanuts. You really will appreciate the reason we love home grown Louisiana food and always ask why eat local grown food?

Welcome back to our Germany Road Trip travel vlog series through Bavaria, Germany, our 29th country on our round the world trip! Our road trip brought us to the magical town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber. Rothenburg is known as the Fairytale Town of Germany and has the Instagram posts to prove it!

After waking up before dawn to soak up the town before the crowds, we explore the gorgeous little town including the medieval walls and Rothenburg Christmas Market stalls. We captured a special moment in front of Plönlein and watched a stunning rainbow arching over Rothenburg in the early hours of the morning. It truly felt like we were living a fairytale!

Next, we drove over to Dinkelsbuhl for an evening at the most local-feeling market we’ve seen yet! If you love half-timbered German buildings, then this town has plenty for you to see!

Heads up, this is our 3rd travel vlog of a multi-part Germany Road Trip series as we drive from Nuremberg to Bamberg and then drive down the Romantic Road from Rothenburg ob der Tauber to the southern tip of Bavaria, ending in Munich! If you missed the first two vlogs, you can find those below.

Hey guys! Welcome back to my new vlog. Today i’ll be bringing you on my trip to GERMANY! I am thankful to have had the chance to visit Munich & Berlin. I stayed in Germany for 6 days, yet only filmed 4 days worth! I honestly fell in love with Munich & Berlin. They each had their differences, yet loved both places equally. The week I was there was definitely cold & gloomy, but I still enjoyed the trip. I went to Marienplatz, Berlin Wall, Museums and many more! I can’t forget to mention all of the amazing food I had! My friend from Germany (which I forgot to introduce 🤦🏻‍♂️) is a foodie like me, so he knew the right spots to take me to. I’m still drooling over the dumplings, the curry and the popular doner kebabs! Germany has so much history, great people and amazing vibes all around. I am looking forward to going back in the future. I had plans to travel to another destination in April, but with this coronavirus taking over this will probably be put on hold. But, we’ll see! Also, I did make it right on time before the travel ban. That being said, please stay informed, stay at home as much as possible and wash your hands! Thanks so much for watching.

Expats call it cultural shock, changes in lifestyle, adjustments, struggles, and first impression of a new culture.  It has been an year living in Germany and I still read about new rules and regulation related to living in Germany. 

Overall, I am glad and happy to experience such a beautiful country, Germany. These moments spent here are unforgettable.

या व्हिडिओ मधे मी कलोनला भेट दिली आहे तसेच बऱ्याच ऐतिहासीक, पारंपरिक आणि रोमँटिक विषयांवर चर्चा केली आहे.

आयुष्यातला पहिली बर्फवृष्टी मी इथेच अनुभवली त्याविषयीचा व्हिडिओ सुद्धा या vlog मधे आहे.

So who exactly moves to Germany from India? In this vlog we will have a casual conversation about this topic. And also about, what is my plan with this channel, how Dogs are treated in Germany, how relying just on English language is not enough here. This is a new kind of video I am attempting. Casual and easy going.

I moved to Germany in 2017. Struggled first few years to learn German language and to find job here. Of course in this time I also experienced not just magnificent Germany but also incredible Europe. I am still learning about this wonderful country and continent. But now I have versatile experience here. These videos include a piece of my life in Germany.

In todays vlog me and my friend Carola explored our own backyard. For Caro's birthday back in July I gave her a voucher for a day trip to somewhere in Germany and wherever she wanted to go. Carola chose Augsburg in Bavaria as it has the same name as her hometown in Italy (if you translate it from Italian into German).

So a few months later we took a train to Augsburg, which is actually only an hour away from where we live. We both were so surprised how pretty Augsburg is and we can definitely recommend coming here.

Enjoy the vlog :)

How are the two countries handling education differently all the way from middle school, high school, university level to job level. And you will also learn how to study in Germany.

BEING BLACK IN GERMANY 🇩🇪

Welcome back 🌿

So I thought it would be interesting to share some of my experiences and focus on some things which happen/happened to me here in Germany as a black woman. Please also note, I do love living in Germany! I made the decision to move here for a reason, and if I could do it again I would 💕

This video is a bit short but I do hope I answered some of your questions.

*DISCLAIMER* This video is representing all of MY experiences! I also want to make it clear that I really do still love Germany despite some of the sad incidents I have faced. There is a reason I moved here in the first place. Living here has provided me with so many opportunities and given me great adventures which I will treasure for the rest of my life. I have met really amazing people and also really nasty ones. But like ANYWHERE in the world this stuff happens. 

I will be making a '5 Reasons Why I Love Germany Video' soon!

Germany is famous for complex and strange insurances. However, often some of these insurances turn out to be very important and in case we do not have them, it can lead to bearing quite a big cost.

We show the importance with a real life happening, which occurred in our household and we learned importance of ""Liability Insurance"" with this.

We talk in detail about ""Liability Insurance"" as well as few other insurances, which one should know about, when she/he comes to Germany (or Europe, in general)

Can you imagine paying 1000% more money for rent, groceries and other stuff than you usually do? Welcome to the world's most expensive country. It is Switzerland. The cost of living index is the crazy high here. There are only six cities in the world currently more expensive than New York and all six of them are in Switzerland. It is also the country with the highest per capita millionaires. But why is this the case? I explain in this video.

Hey guys this is Chris Betzmann and today I will be officially accepting and embracing Islam.
Before I show you the process, which is called Shahada I want to give you a little background Story for all of you who are new to this channel.
I have started this channel last December and spend almost 1 year in Pakistan. During this time I've met sooo many incredible people and learned a lot about the religion and the lifestyle.
Growing up in Europe the word Islam was always connected with negativity, war, terrorism and to be completely honest I was never a religious person before so I didn't really care what people thought back then. My best childhood friends were Muslims and deep inside we are all human beings in the same simulation we call life.  
The Islam is the religion of peace and I felt a deeper connection and something I want to experience and explore deeper for myself.
So yeah if you want me to make a whole video about it please comment down below and make sure to Subscribe to follow my journey.
Here it is, my shahada, enjoy ! 
ALHAMDULILLAH

Tübingen is currently running a pilot program – while almost everything is closed in the rest of the country, here museums, restaurants, and cinemas are open to visitors who have a recent, negative coronavirus test. Dhruv and Juli also pay a visit to the famous Blautopf springs not far from Tübingen, taking in the color of their beautiful, luminous blue waters. 
Watch the episode on April 21 at 3 pm CET / 1 pm UTC. ⁠During the premiere, Dhruv will be online to chat with you and answer your questions.⁠


Please note: Dhruv was in Tübingen at the start of April, 2021. The city’s coronavirus trial project – which amongst other things permitted retailers, and well as arts and culture venues to reopen – was ended on account of the high incidence rates in the county.

In todays vlog I give you all of the important tipps on how you can fit in all of the major sights of beautiful Berlin within ONE DAY. From Brandenburg Gate, over the political sights like Reichstag and Kanzleramt to the East Side Gallery. 

If you didn't know I live in Nuremberg, Bavaria which is in the south of Germany and usually it takes you a long time to go up to our capital. However with the ICE sprinter trains, which were established a few years ago, you can now go up within 3hrs, which makes it perfect for day trip.

This is the first video of the Bali series. I travelled from Delhi to Bali with Malaysia Airlines. I enjoyed the in-flight entertainment, comfortable reclining seats and relished the vegetarian food. Although it would be better if the flagship carrier of Malaysia can offer more variety of food for vegetarians. After reaching Bali, the first target was to get the Visa on arrival. Bali offers free Visa-on-Arrival for Indian citizens.

MUST DO WATERFALLS in BALI! The first two WATERFALLS in the video are really the main ones we recommend. WATERFALL #1 was called TIBUMANA WATERFALL and the second was TUKAD CEPUNG! We arrived at TIBUMANA at 6:30 a.m. and there was not a sole in sight. TIBUMANA was the most magical place we have ever been. We truly felt like we were in a fairytale. TUKAD CEPUNG was also really great. It was super fun to swim in this one. The crowds began to arrive shortly after we got there, which made it crowded and less enjoyable, but it was still very cool to see. All in all, these WATERFALLS are amazing but you have to get there very early if you want it to yourself.

TRAVELING BALI DURING THE PANDEMIC! is it safe? bali travel vlog 2020

Hi there! Thank you so much for clicking on today's Bali vlog! This year we were invited by Wonderful Indonesia to join the Trip of Wonders 2020. We are so grateful to have been given this opportunity and we are super excited to share with you all of the health and safety protocols Indonesia is taking! In this vlog, we travel around Bali for a few days, exploring some waterfalls, major tourist attractions, traditional villages, and more. You can clearly see the measures the Indonesian government is taking in order to keep people safe while also still being able to enjoy all of the beauty the island and the rest of the country has to offer! We had such a great time on this trip and we felt super safe the entire time! Although international borders may not be open just yet, this video will hopefully make you feel more comfortable with booking your next trip to Bali once they open! Anyways, I hope you enjoy this vlog! See ya in the comments xx

irshalgadh fort shows the real beauty of maharashtra 😍😍
this is just my first vlog! more to come 

Irshalgad is a fortress located between Matheran and Panvel in Maharashtra, India. It is a sister fort to Prabalgad. The area of the fort is not large but there are several water cisterns cut from the rock. The nearest village is Irshalwadi.🏞

Irshalgad pinnacle is accessible by an easy to moderate 3.4 kilometre  2 hour trek. The road head, if travelling by your own vehicle is Nanivali village near Chowk town. 🚋
Chowk town lies on NH4 that connects Panvel with Karjat. 
Chowk also has a train station (Station code CHOK) . (Pune - Bhusaval express) stops at Chowk train station. From Chowk, Nanivali village (the starting point of this trek) is a comfortable 2.3 kilometres walk. 
From Nanivali village you follow a wide well defined path till Irshalwadi village. The path climbs a steep ridge and then tapers to an easy ascend till Irshalwadi. From Irshalwadi village head towards a temple dedicated to a local deity and access the Irshalgad plateau via a west-east axis. The trek is child friendly till the pinnacle base.

We typically get around on 2 scooters but here we rented a car for the day to do some shopping.  I don't know why driving a car seems a million times more stressful than riding scooters but it totally is.  We needed to go to the supermarket Bintang and stock up so the car was necessary plus we just wanted to experience what it was like to drive a car in this busy town.  The price is super affordable at $17/ day but the only issue is, if anyone hits you-it's your fault.  Yikes that sucks.  As we toured around town we also checked out Seminyak  beach.  With our family travel vlog we love showing the real side of travel and not just the highlights and adventures.  Traveling as a family has its ups and downs so we want to show other families that it is possible for them too.  The struggle is definitely not greater than the amazing time to be had.

This Vlog was super fun to film and couldnt have asked for a better squad to make it possible! we actually came up with the idea for the intro midway through the trip and shot it on our very last night in Jakarta. We didnt know if it would work but it turned out better than expected haha! hope you guys enjoy this one.

New York Darshan . So as you all know i was in New York for few days and shot few vlogs . This one vlog i made while i was visiting the vessel . Awesome tourist attraction in the heart in New York City . The only problem anyone will have while in New York is the parking that's all if you know how to handle that then you are sorted . The vessels resembles a honeycomb and it has over 2500 steps but its worth the climb , I am really scared of heights but i wanted to make this vlog so that you all can see it too . 
Please let me know how you like it .

This is a 4 part series full of amazing natural beauty, fun road trips, water adventures and lots of masti with friends.  We visited 2 of the beautiful finger lakes as well as Glen Watkins State Park and Letchworth State Park, which are full of green trees, waterfalls and breathtaking views.

In this first vlog of the series, I am showing our 5 hour road trip to our motel. The way was full of amazing views and I have tried to show my journey as best as possible. I hope you enjoy this vlog. This is just the trailer picture abhi baaki hai mere dost.

An exciting and long road trip across 8 states(New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee). 
We opted for ""America's favorite drive"" i.e. blue ridge parkway~ a slow-paced and relaxing drive revealing stunning long range vistas and close up views of the rugged mountains ! It was nice culmination at Smoky mountains and 8th state Tennessee, from where we returned back Home.

Vlog#35: I think it's not a bad thing but there are certain luxuries of life that you can afford in India but not in the USA as the same services cost a lot more here. In this vlog, you'll see me struggling with the cooking and cleaning for which we can't afford any help even we both work full-time here. If you compare the similar case of a software engineer in India then they'll definitely be able to afford some help in a lot of day to day activities. Having said that, I would also like to put it out there that I'm grateful for being here and love to do my stuff on my own.

I appreciate each one of you so much for the constant support and lovely comments. Please drop a thumbs up 👍, if you think I should keep vlogging. 

I came to the USA as a masters student and pursued my education here, if you're interested in studying abroad or doing an MS from the USA then do check out my other channel:

Follow along with me on my FIRST day of American public school...

I don't have a fancy morning routine or anything like that but I do enjoy drinking coffee and riding my bike to school. This year will be my junior year (11th grade) of high school at Chapel Hill High school. It's going to be a busy busy year but before everything gets even crazier I was able to film a video of our first day. I hope you enjoy seeing this perspective into an American high school. 

Let me know what you find interesting or different! Let's start a conversation/dialogue in the comments! 

So, essentially my channel is ""blowing up"" as I write this post. It's all very exciting and I'm so glad to have a ton of new people here! The timing is perfect because my first day of French public school video is where everyone is coming from so what better video to post than my first day of American public school! I hope you all enjoy it and a big welcome to those who are new around here!

Hey #GGSquad, How are you?
When I think of Budapest, I think about beautiful skies, delicious food, SO MANY desserts and endless stories. It surely is cheap compared to other European cities and is full of culture and good vibes. 
In this video, I show you a short vlog of my trip to Budapest. This vlog is a highlight only, and not a full vlog. There are many other things in Budapest that you must try like Thermal baths, ruin bars, etc.

Some tips:
1. Carry a bottle of water with you before you start your day not just in Budapest, but everywhere. It reduces the usage of plastic bottles and you will stay hydrated, all the time.
2. Buy a city pass from any metro station or go for a Budapest Card. Buy the one which you can use to its full value.
3. You can take a tour of Hungarian Parliament from the inside too. It will cost you extra bucks so think before you opt for it.
4. Make sure you eat desserts :)

Some places I went to in this vlog (You can search them on Google and find all location details)
Hungarian Parliament, Danube River Cruise, Pizza Forte, Gelarto Rose, St. Stephen's Basilica, Christmas Market and Molnár's kürtőskalács.

Come along on a week in Paris with me! I meant to post this a little while ago but I literally just moved to NYC yesterday so I'm a bit behind on all my content right now. Paris was such a dream to enjoy with my family and friends! I lived in Paris on my own when I was 18/19 so it was so amazing to get to show off my favorite spots to some of my favorite people. We didn't hit many of the main touristy spots because most of us had done them before and wanted to just enjoy every day life in the city.

So, I had just a little more than 24 hours in Amsterdam before going to Spain so we decided to cover as many places in Central Amsterdam as possible. In this video I am enjoying the Canal cruise tour along with the cheese tasting and a visit to Madame Tussauds. Amsterdam has so many exciting things to offer that one day was obviously just not enough.

ইউরোপের সর্বোচ্চ চূড়ায় বাংলাদেশের পতাকা নিয়ে আমরা ৪জন ! Jungfraujoch , Top Of Europe ! Switzerland | Bangla Travel Vlog

🏔📍🇨🇭JUNGFRAUJOCH
TOP OF EUROPE
Icy air streams across your face, snow crunches under your feet, and the view nearly takes your breath away: on one side the view of the Mittelland up to the Vosges, on the other the Aletsch glacier, bordered by four thousand metre peaks. Standing on the Jungfraujoch 3,454 metres above sea level, you can feel it with your first step: this is a different world. It's one you have to experience.
Getting to Jungfraujoch – Top of Europe

With the Bernese Oberland Railway from Interlaken Ost station to Lauterbrunnen or Grindelwald Terminal. Journey time from Interlaken Ost via Eiger Express: 1 hour 30 minutes.

🇨🇭🏔One of the most popular things to do in the beautiful Bernese Oberland is the train journey to Jungfraujoch, the ""Top of Europe,"" with an observation terrace and scientific observatory perched at 3,454 meters. The longest glacier in Europe, the Great Aletsch Glacier begins at Jungfraujoch, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The famous Eiger Trail from the Eiger glacier station to Alpiglen clings to the rocks at the foot of the north face.

Other popular walks include Panorama Way to the sunny, south-facing First slope; the Gletscherschlucht (Glacier Gorge); and Öpfelchüechliwäg, the high-altitude trail from Holenstein to Brandegg through fields of flowers, alpine pastures, and woodlands. The less active can ride gondolas and cable cars to scenic viewpoints over the Lauterbrunnen Valley.

Picturesque Grindelwald is a glacier village in the Jungfrau region, which makes a great base for adventures into the surrounding mountains. It nestles at the base of snow-cloaked mountains and is one of Switzerland's oldest and most popular resorts. Towering above this alpine valley is the tiara-shaped Wetterhorn and the sheer north face of the Eiger, one of the planet's most dramatic and difficult climbs. Between the mountains lie Grindelwald's two glinting glaciers. For the best views, Faulhorn, at 2,681 meters, offers breathtaking panoramas of the giant peaks.

From Scandinavia's striking snow-coated scenery to the charming coastlines of the Mediterranean, Europe is full of diverse and dreamy landscapes that belie its relatively small size. While its world-class capitals of London, Paris, and Rome attract the most visitors, the continent's 44 countries each have delightfully different cities and attractions to explore.  With so many sublime sights and sensational scenery to see, visiting all of Europe's most beautiful destinations could take a lifetime.

This chicken francese recipe has reached over 200 million views on Facebook and I kid you not.  It's by far my most popular recipe.  Let me know what you think. Click below for recipe.

I believe Chicken Francaise, also known as Francese, was created in America by Italian immigrants. As with numerous Italian chicken dishes, they were originally intended for veal but taste equally as good with chicken. But back to the name, why an American Italian dish is called “French”, maybe it’s because of all the butter, maybe the wine, but one thing for sure, the flavours are superb! Enjoy it with a rich and dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay, or even a light red such as Gamay or Pinot Noir.  This chicken recipe has gone viral throughout the internet with amazing success. Let me know what you think of this recipe.

483K subscribers

LONDON STREET FOOD, BOROUGH MARKET, FRESH FOOD MARKET IN LONDON, BOROUGH, Borough Market is a wholesale and retail food market in Southwark, London, England. It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in London,[1][2] with a market on the site dating back to at least the 12th century. The present buildings were built in the 1850s, and today the market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public.  The present market, located on Southwark Street and Borough High Street just south of Southwark Cathedral on the southern end of London Bridge, is a successor to one that originally adjoined the end of London Bridge. It was first mentioned in 1276, although the market itself claims to have existed since 1014 ""and probably much earlier""[3] and was subsequently moved south of St Margaret's church on the High Street.[4] The City of London received a royal charter from Edward VI in 1550 to control all markets in Southwark (see Guildable Manor), which was confirmed by Charles II in 1671. However, the market caused such traffic congestion that, in 1754, it was abolished by an Act of Parliament.[5][6]

The Act allowed for the local parishioners to set up another market on a new site, and in 1756, it began again on a 4.5-acre (18,000 m²) site in Rochester Yard.[5][6] During the 19th century, it became one of London's most important food markets due to its strategic position near the riverside wharves of the Pool of London.[5]

The retail market operates on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Fridays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The wholesale market operates on all weekday mornings from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m.  The present-day market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public. However, in the 20th century, it was essentially a wholesale market, selling produce in quantity to greengrocers. It was the main supplier, along with Covent Garden, of fruits and vegetables to retail greengrocers' shops. Amongst the notable businesses trading in the market were Vitacress, Lee Brothers (potato merchants whose signage can still be seen in the market), Manny Sugarman, AW Bourne and Eddy Robbins. JO Sims, the main importer for South African citrus fruit (Outspan), were also located in the market.


Vegetable stall
Stallholders come to trade at the market from different parts of the UK, and traditional European products are also imported and sold. Amongst the produce on sale are fresh fruit and vegetables, cheese, meat, game, baked bread and pastries.

The market is a charitable trust administered by a board of volunteer trustees, who have to live in the area.[10]

Borough Market and the surrounding streets have been used as a film location for such features as Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004).[11] As reported by the London Evening Standard, the market is available to hire for private events. From 1860, the railway operating companies desired to extend services from London Bridge station into new stations at Cannon Street and Blackfriars in the City and link to the West End at Charing Cross Station. This required a viaduct, but legally, it was impossible by the 1756 Borough Market Act for the Trustees to alienate their property. The compromise was that only a flying leasehold was given to the railway company for the permanent way, but only for as long as a railway operates on it. The Market continues to trade underneath the arches of the viaduct. Each time there is a railway expansion requiring widening of the viaduct, the Trustees receive a full compensation payment. The last major such expansion was the 1901 extended bridge widening; the 21st-century works programme will also make its contribution. These windfalls have assisted in the finances of the market without any loss of amenity to it. A new viaduct was erected above the market and a bridge across Borough High Street completed in 2014.


First span of the new Borough Market viaduct at Stoney Street
As part of the Thameslink Programme, a large number of listed buildings in the Borough Market area have been altered or demolished,[13] affecting the historic fabric of the area. This includes parts of the market itself and much of the area appearing in the aforementioned films. This was unpopular locally and became a contentious issue in the resulting public inquiry, which resulted in delays to the project. Eventually, the inquiry inspector was satisfied with the plans to restore as much of the market and surrounding area as possible. The overriding need to remove a major bottleneck in the national rail network and improve transport options over a large portion of London meant that he accepted that some damage to the fabric of the market and surrounding area was unavoidable in order for the scheme to achieve its objectives. Disruption to the market activities was kept to a minimum.

LONDON STREET FOOD, Southbank Centre’s food market offers fantastic street food, a great range of beers, wines and cocktails, delicious coffee, tea and sweet treats – with a selection of fresh produce to take home, and guest traders each week. All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London’s top food destinations.

You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.

What’s to eat?
Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian’s family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather’s hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you’re getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.

What we like (and don't like) to eat is deeply personal and often weird to others.  Some of us are naturally curious and experimental eaters.  Others like to stick to what they know.  For some, the plate is a battlefield, featuring wars on fats, allergies, spices and indigestion.

I have always been an eclectic eater: I knew I liked my pasta al dente before I knew that Italy existed.  Through years of traveling, my culinary compass is delighted by only 5 cuisines:
- Japanese
- Thai
- Chinese (esp. Sichuan)
- Italian (esp. Southern)
- French (esp. Southern)

[I also tolerate Turkish/Greek/Middle Eastern, but find these foods do better when cooked at home, rather than in restaurants, in general].

The rest of the world is, for me, a terrifying gastronomical challenge.  One of the worst black holes in this universe is *Eastern Europe*, the land of meat-and-potatoes, cabbage & beets.  And soggy beige dumplings.

Here's how I cope when I go there...

The United Kingdom and the European Union have banned A LOT of American food. So if you're curious about American food that is banned in other countries, this video is for you 🍟🍔🍕

NOTE: In most cases, the UK and EU have banned specific ingredients in these foods, not the foods themselves. For example, BVO is banned in the UK, so American-style Mountain Dew (which contains BVO) is banned, but there is a special UK-style Mountain Dew sold in the UK that doesn't have BVO. So what is banned is the American version of the food. 

This is similar to how UK-produced Cadbury is banned in the USA, but American-produced Cadbury can be found all across America. 🍫

In the heart of Brussels Belgium I found an Indian restaurant. I went and looked at the price given and ordered my usual mutton biryani since it's my favorite Indian dish. The staff was nice even though I found it a bit weird that the head chef stands outside in the middle of the road blatantly looking around at the air. My Indian food was good and tasty however lets be clear what I ate was 100 light years away from being an authentic biryani. I would call it more a fried rice or pulao than a biryani, nonetheless I enjoyed my meal and that is the most important. 

At the end I noticed I was charged a little higher than what was stated on the menu. After talking with the staff they agreed to charge me what I read on the menu but they didn't really seem to care much as no apology was given and when I suggested they should fix the typo they just shrugged their shoulders and went about their day. At the end of the day my food was decently good however I know I won't be returning to this establishment when my Indian cravings return.

Policy Seminar:
European Green Deal -- Farm to Fork Strategy for Sustainable Food
Co-Organized by IFPRI and the European Union
FEB 18, 2020 - 12:15 PM TO 01:30 PM EST
The “Farm to Fork” Strategy, part of the European Commission’s Green Deal, is integral to Europe’s ambitious response to climate change challenges along the food chain. The “Farm to Fork” strategy reflects the ongoing transformation of food systems worldwide and the goal of making Europe’s food system the gold standard for sustainability. “Farm to Fork” is also linked directly to current discussions on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.

The EU experience is highly relevant to the debate around food system transformation—Europe’s policy- and private-driven initiatives demonstrate that green best practices can be successful in jointly increasing economic efficiency and environmental and climate sustainability. This seminar will review the “Farm to Fork” strategy and its implications for European and global agriculture.

""We go to the wholesalers, we take palettes for nothing, we sort them and hand them out,"" Langlais said. ""Right now it's a bit hit-and-miss. There are days when we get lots of produce, and others when there's less. We have to buy anything that we can't get free from the wholesalers.""

so that's my ranking (starting with the best)

🇫🇮 Finland - loved it. Not only did it keep me full for so long, but it also is probably the healthiest in my opinion. Porridge warms you from the inside, so it’s perfect for autumn and winter times.
 +  Everything was made from scratch. Took me about 15-20 min. to make it. 
- (kept me full for around 5 hours) 

🇬🇧 UK - depending if you are making this from scratch and which kind of bread you are using, this is more or less healthy. I just loved the taste, but my version was definitely not the healthiest. 
(make the beans from scratch, use brown bread and it would share the first place with Finland)  
- (kept me full for around 5 hours) 

🇨🇾 Cyprus - speaking of health.. probably on the same level as Finland. All the veg you are getting from it as well as the healthy fats from the olives and the carbs from the bread are making this to a really nutritious meal. And then there’s the cheese.. for me, using vegan cheese no problem. For normal cheese: don’t feel bad either. All the other ingredients are balancing it out well. 
(just on the 3rd place because it didn't satisfy me as much as I thought it would do - I'll have it again but probably for lunch) 
- (kept me full for around 3 hours) 

🇨🇿 Czech Republic - the rye (or at least dark) bread is probably the healthiest part about this. Still it is a really tasty breakfast. I can only recommend making the marmelade yourself or getting it from your mom. Not only does it make a big difference in taste but you also can control how sweet you want it to be etc. 
- (kept me full for around 3 hours) 

🇮🇹 Italy - for me Italy is like the Czech Republic when it comes to the food I had. It was very similar. One just slightly healthier. For other Italian breakfast speaking (cookie for example) ..this doesn’t feel like breakfast to me. BUT if you are not someone who’s having breakfast normally, you could really like it, like this. Just don’t think your body cells will love you for that haha. Still, it is tasty! 
- (kept me full for around 3 hours) 
......................................................................................................................................................................

thank you for watching! 

have a nice day or night 
until next time :)

We asked young, ordinary Europeans to take a look at U.S. policies on everything from food to guns. As they discover facts about America, they’re not impressed.

Sometimes it’s useful to get an outside perspective. In the Video Op-Ed above, Europeans are shocked to learn that the American government does not guarantee social protections that citizens in other advanced economies take for granted. 

Their reactions reflect how European governments prioritize citizen welfare, offering national assurances like universal health care and affordable education. Americans have grown accustomed to the exorbitant costs of basic human services, the absence of parental leave protection and the unregulated presence of chemicals in food — things that would “cause riots” in Europe. 

It’s true that the United States grapples with a larger and more diverse population than that of any European country. But with the resources of the world’s largest economy and as keepers of the American dream, can’t policymakers find solutions?

The action is a fundamental part of 4GOODFOOD.

We are facing significant crises today. More than 690 million people are undernourished and soon an additional 130 million people could join their ranks. Another 115 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty. The transformation of agri-food systems is essential to produce healthy foods and make them accessible, cut food loss and waste, and protect the environment through sustainable production of food. To achieve the ultimate goal of eliminating hunger, it's important to measure and minimize the tradeoffs of policies that are put in place to meet different goals.

In today’s global commodity markets, the prices that European food manufacturing and packaged goods companies pay for the ingredients they use to make or ship food change constantly.

Ow0DjMjbkbY,"Top 10 Exotic, Weird and Traditional Eastern European Foods Only The Brave Should Try","Edmund Boqueo
SUBSCRIBE
When you talk about Eastern European cuisine, most people think of rich comfort foods, hearty stews, like the Hungarian Goulash, stuffed cabbage rolls, Polish Kielbasa, smoked meats and pickles. But as is the case with many other cuisines, even the Eastern Europeans have a few “skeletons” hidden in their pantry.

Believe it or not, they don’t try their best to come up with the weirdest combinations or ingredients you can think of. While nose-to-tail eating might be a foreign concept for the Western countries, these recipes are hundreds of years old and were created out of necessity. Food was scarce, meat was not always available, so whenever an animal was slaughtered, people had to come up with a way to use almost every part of it. And before you get all judgy, keep in mind that no matter where you come from, there is a chance your ancestors used to eat some of these unusual ingredients.

Food culture has changed a lot over the past few years. Millennials travel around the world with the intent of discovering new foods and trying unusual recipes.

The webinar focusses on the supply chain of Fruit & Vegetable Juices and Purees within the Farm to Fork Strategy (F2F). The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Trade Policies will be a cornerstone in this sustainability transition. However, ensuring sustainability, encapsulates ambitious targets like the reduction of pesticides, the demand for organic products, IPM practices, as well understanding the role of GMOs & digital farming to commercialize our products. And, in this whirlpool of new concepts, biodiversity will play an important role too. On the other hand, the Water Framework Directive (EC 2000/60) will become essential in Agriculture Policy to preserve water resources and avoid contamination with pesticides and other chemicals.

In my years of watching Mark Wiens, I came to the realization that most of his reviews are positive, and finding anything negative was like finding a needle in a haystack.  In addition, none of the big YouTube bloggers don't bother to create a ""Worst"" Experiences compilation.  For sure, their ""Best Food Experiences"" can be found everywhere, but not their worst.  So, I have decided to create a ""worst"" experience caught on camera for the audiences viewing pleasure.  This will save you the hassle of looking for these videos manually.

One of my favorite things to do when I’m at home is to eat nothing but Indian food for 24 hours straight in different cities around Florida. This time around, my eating adventure is taking place in Sunrise, and I’m being joined by my boy Patrick Blackwood!

Sunrise is located roughly an hour north of Miami and is known for its Indian restaurants. We were going to hit up three of them today, starting with a south Indian breakfast at Woodlands Veg Indian Cuisine. I couldn’t wait to have some dosas!

Today we have discovered Indian food in Mexico. Half a world away in Central America we found one of the most beautiful Indian restaurants we have ever seen. We walked in to try the Indian food abroad and see if it was the same as in India or better. The chef is South Indian from Kerala and the owner is a fan of the channel. We tried our favorite drinks the mango lassi and a coconut lassi as well as some chicken tikka, malai kebabs, mutton curry, and chana masala. Of course all this was accompanied by naan and roti as well as a lacha paratha. This was one of my best Indian food experiences outside of the Indian sub continent. Hope you guys are hungry and ready for this delicious Indian food vlog.

In the premiere episode of Family Food, we head to Swagath Gourmet, a South Indian restaurant run by the Iyengar family in Edison, New Jersey. We meet brothers Sesha and Murali as well as Murali's wife Padma, who all share a passion for bringing authentic South Indian food to the table. The lentil- and rice-based vegetarian dishes that have made Swagath a local favorite are not only delicious, but also extremely healthy. After spending time with the Iyengars in their restaurant and their tight-knit community of Edison, we see it's no coincidence that the word ""swagath"" means ""welcome"" in their native tongue. The minute you walk into Swagath, you feel like a part of the family.

She tried Indian alcohol for the first time, indo chinese appetizers, a grand variety of veg and non veg curries, tandoor chicken, lamb, and prawns. We couldn't forget about desert such as gulab jamun and kulfi which is Indian ice cream. The folks at Rasoi Indian cuisine make some of the best Indian food I ever tried in America. The owner/chef is from Pune and the lovely waitress is from Assam. Together they run this Indian restaurant in America to perfection and make some authentic delicious food day in and day out.

Come with me on my latest adventure, eating Indian food for 24 hours in Coral Springs, Florida!

My adventure took me to Coral Springs, a city roughly an hour north of Miami. It’s one of the best places in south Florida to eat Indian cuisine. I started at Salma’s Cuisine for breakfast!

SUBSCRIBE
BREAKFAST BATTLES: Yes, I've come up with a great excuse to eat TWO breakfasts! 
In todays episode I'm pitting two of my favourite things against each other, South Indian breakfast and a traditional English Fry.

A full-English breakfast is popular all around the UK and it's what I grew up eating on Sundays at a restaurant or cooked by my Gran. Sausage, eggs, bacon, toast...and on special occasions BLACK PUDDING. Blood sausage is the best addition to the meal- you may not like how it sounds but it tastes amaaaazing.

In the other corner is a South Indian breakfast with idly, medhu vada, pongal, masala dosa, chutneys and tea. I may not have grown up eating dosas for breakfast, but they were a family favourite we'd often eat.

Now, for no good reason, I'm trying to decide which is BETTER: Indian or English breakfast!

Where I ate:

For this video, we headed down to Kwee Zeen at Sofitel Sentosa to DESTROY a Massive Royal Indian Food Platter! Kwee Zeen offers a host of Pan-Asian cuisine with a touch of Western and an emphasis on French-style hospitality and décor. Kwee Zeen has a Taste of Singapore promotion where they take you through different types of cuisine depending on the day of the week. On Saturday nights, they offer a special Indian platter called the Royal Maharaja Feast that comfortably feeds 4. There is a GIVEAWAY, details below.

Served on a ginormous banana leaf, the staff plated a ridiculous variety of different Northern Indian food, including naans, tandoori meats, salads and gulab jamun. The presentation from the chef was something to behold. The selection of dishes was also exceptional, very well balanced in terms of meat to carbs to vegetables. 

The standout foods would be the tandoori lamb chops, which was well-seasoned and tender, the cauliflower, which was slightly charred on the outside while moist inside after being roasted whole and the pomegranate and potato salad, which was cooling and refreshing, working well to counteract any residual heat. The chutneys served were also a step above most chutneys I have tried. On top of that, I really enjoyed the 2 desserts served, especially the carrot halwa which was unique to me and not overpoweringly sweet.

Due to the balance of food and the overall deliciousness, this almost did not feel like a challenge. I felt pretty decent afterwards which is particular rare to occur. True to its name, you and your family can eat like Kings if you order this platter at Kwee Zeen. It would be well worth your money at $192++ for 4. Do check out Kwee Zeen for this magical feast!

GIVEAWAY
We are giving away a 2D1N staycation at Sofitel Sentosa! To apply, comment on my IG post for this video, tagging who you would like to bring on this staycation. I will be picking one lucky winner.

I stumbled upon a group of rickshaw drivers parked up at a roadside restaurant just a few metres from the Indian Prime Minister's house, so I knew the food had to be great!

The Indian rickshaw drivers were all there for a ₹30 thali (plate of food). It's a massive plate with dal, rice, pakora, and papad on it. Drivers in India need a big feed at lunch because they work such long hours, and this was the perfect place for them to get it.

I also interview the owner and take you behind the scenes to the kitchen where this Indian street food is being prepared - although it's not very clean! The restaurant is actually on Government land and could be moved on at any point, but so far it's been there for many years.

Indian food has forever touched my heart. I feel sad that I only discovered it a few years ago and wasted so many years of my life not eating so I feel the need to have others try it. Today I am going to have my cousins try Indian food. I am going to introduce a great variety of dishes to them and explain certain things that I have learned about Indian food to them. We ordered of course some biryani, some chicken korma, some Indian veggie dishes that are new to me as well and some dessert. Hope you're packing an appetite because we are diving head first into this Indian food vlog.

If you love street food, then Juhu Beach is the place to be when in Mumbai. It's a popular hangout place for locals and tourists where you can find a variety of stalls selling Indian food, Pan Asian food, and all sorts of desserts. 

Right after the stop for street food, we went to a Gomantak Restaurant that specializes in Malvani cuisine, which basically serves a lot of seafood. One of the must-try items was the Bombay Duck Fry (which isn't duck, but fish) as well as the Pomfret Masala.

Shawarmas are a very popular street snack in India, and I went a little crazy and went for a chocolate shawarma that a nearby restaurant stall sold. It was pretty interesting and a combination I have never thought of. 

Finally, we ended it all with some Kulfi! Kulfi is a very authentic type of Indian ice cream that is super creamy! The man who sells it has been at this location for over 23 years! What's crazy is that he gets up every morning, makes it for 5-6 hours, rides his bike for one hour (with this huge bin of kulfi ON the bike), sells it, rides his bike back, and repeats! His hard work really pays off, because this was probably the best kulfi I have had in India.

Today I found a Bengali Indian Food Truck in America, specifically in South Miami in the state of Florida. I was driving by and saw this gem and had to stop to check it out and try out the Indian food. One of the owners is Bengali from Kolkata as well as his brother that cooks the food, the other owner is Bolivian and his daughter tried out the Indian food with me for the first time. They also sell a Kolkata style biryani with a potato in it putting the signature Bengali stamp on the food they sell. Throw in some kathi rolls and you got yourself some authentic Bengali Indian food. Join me on this Indian food vlog as we explore the Indian food truck in America and see how the flavors of Indian are doing in this food truck. Hope you're hungry

Trying AMAZING Keralan/South Indian dishes!

Before lockdown we ventured to East Ham in East London to do an Indian food tour of some of the best South Indian food in the city. East Ham is not only known for great South Indian food, but particularly cuisine from Kerala, India.

Kerala is a coastal state, and the food has been shaped by the multitude of cultures that have passed through the area: South East Asia traders, Portuguese and multiple religious traditions from Hindus, Christians and Muslims. 

East Ham is known for their large Indian community, so you know the food is amazing! We tried so many dishes for the first time and I got to introduce Alba & Teresa to South Indian classics like DOSA! 

Another tasty food tour in London! When lockdown ends I can't wait to head back to East Ham to try more.

Indian food is something that once you try it, it will forever be in your heart where ever you go. That was the case in the Netherlands. I got hungry, found a beautiful a canal with Indian restaurants next to it and went in to try out the Indian food abroad.

For this Indian food vlog I went in with my all time favorite the biryani and a kingfisher. Sophie tried her classic garlic naan along with some chicken tikka. I have tried these dishes many times but they never taste the same so had to go in for a taste. Now this Indian restaurant is in a very touristic place which means rent is high so the prices will be high but what about the quality, was the Indian food good? bad? or better? Lets find out

The Indian culinary experience has been diversified and modified to a large extent owing to the waves of migration, climate and the tastes of the local population. As a result, Indian food in general, and street food in particular, draws inspiration from multiple sources but always reflects local tastes. Hugely popular, very affordable, and wonderfully delicious, Indian street food has come to represent a remarkable innovation and adaptation to the changing times. From Mumbai to Delhi to Lucknow and Kolkata- the film travels through the sheer size, variety and nuances within the Indian food palette seen through the eyes of four celebrities, who take the viewer on an intimate culinary exploration of the street food they love in their cities.

LONDON STREET FOOD, Southbank Centre’s food market offers fantastic street food, a great range of beers, wines and cocktails, delicious coffee, tea and sweet treats – with a selection of fresh produce to take home, and guest traders each week. All our stallholders are committed to providing food that bursts with fresh, vibrant flavours, inspired by cuisines from Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. No wonder SCFood Market is one of London’s top food destinations.

You can find the market on Southbank Centre Square each weekend including bank holidays and for an extended market at the end of summer.

What’s to eat?
Perfectly grilled corn-on-the-cob, the best moong dal dosas in town, Korean burritos, vegan Ethiopian, craft beers, interesting cocktails, cake, ice cream, great coffee... in other words, LOADS!  Bread Tree make bruschetta the way families in Italy have done for centuries, no short cuts. They use bread made in a small bakery in Sicily, and offer vegan and wheat-free options too! Seasonings and toppings are all sourced in Calabria, such as pickled aubergines, sundried tomatoes, pesto Calabrese, sundried tomato paste and nduja.

Also on the menu are piadina, the delicious Italian flatbread sandwich. Go for the traditional parma ham or check out one of the veggie or vegan options, all served with sauces that come from southern Italy.

Cristian’s family is originally from Calabria, where his grandfather was a producer of wine and olive oil. Rebecca, originally from Taiwan, also comes from a country where people are very passionate about great food, and she has contributed to Bread Tree her dedication to healthy ingredients.  Tea, Bread & Brownie brings a wide selection of teas, real Belgian hot chocolate and chai latte to serve at the market, as well as retail teas to take home and brew.

Also check out their range of Flour Station sourdough breads, pastries and sweet and savoury treats including cheese straws, savoury muffins, brownies, cream teas, and more, all of which have been freshly baked.

As well as buying teas to take home, you can enjoy a hot cup of tea to go. If the weather’s hot, why not try their range of ice teas and iced chai latte all summer.  The Polish Deli London offers a wide range of delicious and authentic Polish food. Sample traditionally madepork smoked sausages served with salad and pickles in a baguette, or with roasted baby potatoes, cured meats, Polish draught beer and, in winter, sauerkraut stew, made with smoked pork sausage.  When Will and Kerry hand you your gourmet burger, you’re getting it from the hands of the same people who raised the cows and grew the wheat and grass they feasted on. The beef is hung on the bone for three weeks, then they seam cut the beef (a continental style of butchery which cuts around the muscles rather than slicing straight through them). They bind the burgers with their own free range eggs. 

And if that is not enough for you, pop a couple of their steaks in your bag to take home.

This video is so funny hahaha This is what happens when you serve this type of Italian food to an Italian. Watch the video to see the Italian reaction to some of the most popular Italian dishes served in Italian-American Restaurants. Italians are very proud of their food and food is one of the most important things in Italian culture. Italian cuisine is well respected all over the globe and it's been ranked in the top 3 cuisines in the world for many many years. Italian cuisine vary from city to city and from region to region and every dish has a story and tradition. Eating Italian food should be a memorable experience. There are so many different recipes in Italy and Italians who live in Italy haven't tried all of them yet. Next time you order a chicken pasta or alfredo pasta think twice. Don't waste your money for popular food but instead learn more about Italian culture and it's food. For Italians Food is more important then the bible.

Obesity in America has reached a crisis point. Two out of every three Americans are overweight, one out of every three is obese. One in three are expected to have diabetes by 2050. 

Minorities have been even more profoundly affected. African-Americans have a 50 per cent higher prevalence of obesity and Hispanics 25 per cent higher when compared with whites. 

How did the situation get so out of hand? 

On this week's episode of Fault Lines, Josh Rushing explores the world of cheap food for Americans living at the margins. 

What opportunities do people have to eat healthy? Who is responsible for food deserts and processed food in American schools? 

Fault Lines finds food revolutions taking place and speaks with the people that are fighting back.

Lw7EixBGu60,Chicken Francaise Recipe over 200 Million Views,"Recipe30
754K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
This chicken francese recipe has reached over 200 million views on Facebook and I kid you not.  It's by far my most popular recipe.  Let me know what you think. Click below for recipe.

I believe Chicken Francaise, also known as Francese, was created in America by Italian immigrants. As with numerous Italian chicken dishes, they were originally intended for veal but taste equally as good with chicken. But back to the name, why an American Italian dish is called “French”, maybe it’s because of all the butter, maybe the wine, but one thing for sure, the flavours are superb! Enjoy it with a rich and dry white wine such as Sauvignon Blanc or Chardonnay, or even a light red such as Gamay or Pinot Noir.  This chicken recipe has gone viral throughout the internet with amazing success. Let me know what you think of this recipe.

Japanese Food is awesome, and the overall dining experience is just as fun. If you are looking for places to eat in Tokyo, here are five great Japanese food experiences that I love while living in Tokyo. 

1. Japanese Grill (Robata) - You sit around a few men who cook all of the meat and vegetables right in front of you on a grill. You just point to what you want and they grab it with their giant wooden spatulas. 

2. Ramen - My favorite Japanese food, and perhaps the most well recognized Japanese dish apart from sushi. There are hundreds of places to choose from in Tokyo, each with their own rendition of the classic. One spot where you can get a large variety of options is on ""Ramen Street"" in the lower level of Tokyo Station. 

3. Yakitori - Meat and veggies on sticks, cooked over a similar grill as the Robata, Yakitori is a favorite among Tokyo residents because it's fast and goes great with beer. The most famous area for Yakitori in Tokyo is down ""Memory Lane"" or ""Piss Alley"" just outside the Shinjuku Train Station. 

4. Chanko Nabe - The ultimate in gluttony for a normal civilian, but a necessary bulking strategy for up-and-coming sumo wresters in the Ryogoku neighborhood of Tokyo. There are many different versions of this massive stew, and they are all aggressive and delicious. 

5. Conveyor Belt Sushi - As I mention in the video, there are a million different ways sushi is served in Tokyo. One of the most fun methods is by way of the conveyor belt sushi. 

*Bonus* - Convenient stores such as FamilyMart, Lawson's, and 7 Eleven are a major part of Japanese Food culture in Tokyo. People are busy and need a quick meal, so I wanted to take you around real quick and show you what's inside!

6.61M subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Fugu (河豚 or 鰒; フグ) is the Japanese word for pufferfish and the dish prepared from it, normally species of genus Takifugu, Lagocephalus, or Sphoeroides, or porcupinefish of the genus Diodon. Fugu can be lethally poisonous due to its tetrodotoxin; therefore, it must be carefully prepared to remove toxic parts and to avoid contaminating the meat.

The restaurant preparation of fugu is strictly controlled by law in Japan and several other countries, and only chefs who have qualified after three or more years of rigorous training are allowed to prepare the fish. Domestic preparation occasionally leads to accidental death.

Fugu is served as sashimi and chirinabe. Some consider the liver to be the tastiest part, but it is also the most poisonous, and serving this organ in restaurants was banned in Japan in 1984. Fugu has become one of the most celebrated and notorious dishes in Japanese cuisine.

Why are Japanese people so thin? What do people eat in Japan? While the rest of the world is seeing anywhere from 15 to over 30% of its population severely overweight, Japan has managed to keep that number at just 3.6%. When it comes to health tips, it's better to turn to the country with the longest life expectancy and one of the lowest obesity rates on the planet. If you’re ready to find out how the Japanese manage to stay so effortlessly thin, keep our new video!

In Japan, they usually stick to 3 wholesome meals a day that don’t leave them hungry or dealing with sudden cravings. Those who do snack keep it in small quantities and with a lot of moderation.
Also, the secret to Japan’s success begins with their diet, which is pretty carb-heavy and low in saturated fats. Their main dishes of choice include vegetables, grains, fish, and meat. Dairy products and fruits are consumed in moderation. They tend to stay away from foods with excessive amounts of salt and sugar, like burgers and soda.

〇Natto is a fermented food made by fermenting well-steamed soybeans with natto bacillus. Natto is a fermented food made by fermenting well-steamed soybeans with bacillus subtilis. It is different from sweet natto, which is a kind of confectionery. It is often thought to be unique to Japan, but similar foods exist in various regions.

It is said that the term ""natto"" first appeared in the ""Shin-Sarugaku-ki"" of the middle of the Heian period (794-1185) when it was described as ""vegetarian food, spring, salty fermented soybeans. It is said that the name ""natto"" originated from the fact that natto was made as a vegetarian dish in the storerooms of Zen temples, according to a book titled ""Honchosho-kan"" (published in 1697) [5]. It is said that the monks who worked at the barn made natto, so the name ""natto"" was derived from the character for barn. However, the ""Honchokagakkan"" puts a question mark on the theory of the origin of temples and shrines because the name is found in the ""Shin Sarugaku-ki"" before the arrival of Zen [6].

Other theories are that it came to be called natto from ""beans that were delivered,"" such as those delivered into pots, etc., delivered to the shogun, or delivered to the gods [7][8]. There is also a theory that the traditional itobiki natto was made by boiling soybeans, letting them cool, and placing them in a bundle of rice straw called a ""bract"" [9].

On the other hand, there is a theory that the word ""natto"" was introduced through temples because the pronunciation of natto is a combination of ""nak"", the customary Wu sound for ""natto"", and ""tou"", the Chinese sound for ""bean"", and Wu is often used in the pronunciation of words related to Buddhism [10].

There is a popular belief that the name ""tofu"" was originally derived from the fermented beans, and ""natto"" from the molded beans, but this is a false myth. However, this is a false myth. While natto is a word unique to Japan, tofu is a food that came from China and is also called tofu in China, so it is impossible for the two to be confused.

〇納豆（なっとう）は、よく蒸した大豆を納豆菌によって発酵させた発酵食品。 一般的に「糸引き納豆」を指す。 菓子の一種である甘納豆とは異なる。 日本固有と思われがちだが、類似の食品ものは様々な地域に存在する

平安中期の『新猿楽記』の中で「精進物、春、塩辛納豆」とあるのが初見で、この『猿楽記』がベストセラーになったことにより、納豆という記され方が広まったとされる。また、納豆は精進料理として主に禅寺の納所（なっしょ、寺院の倉庫）で作られた食品で、これが名前の由来という説が『本朝食鑑』（1697年刊）という書物に載っている[5]。納所に勤めていた僧侶が納豆作りをしていたので、納所の字をとって「納豆」になったという。ただし、『本朝食鑑』では、禅の伝来以前に『新猿楽記』に名があることから寺社起源説には疑問符をつけている[6]。

その他の説としては、壺などに納めた、将軍に納めた、神様に納めたなど、「納めた豆」から納豆と呼ばれるようになったというものがある[7][8]。また、伝統的な糸引き納豆は、大豆を煮たのを冷まして、稲藁を束ねた「苞（つと）」とよばれる包みの中に入れて製造された[9]ことから、稲藁に納めた豆で「納豆」と呼ばれるようになったという説もある。

他方で、納豆の発音が、納の呉音の慣用的発音である「ナッ」と、豆の漢音である「トウ」を合わせたものであり、呉音は仏教関係の語の発音に多く用いられている点から、寺院を通じて伝来したという説もある[10]。

「本来は豆を腐らせた（発酵させた）ものが豆腐、型に納めたものが納豆だったが、両者が取り違えられた」という名称の由来が語られることがあるが、これは誤った俗説である。納豆が日本独自の言葉であるのに対し、豆腐は中国から伝来した食品であり中国でも豆腐と呼ばれており、取り違えられることはあり得ない。

Join us as we try traditional Japanese Food in a Ryokan eating a multi-course Kaiseki dinner in Takayama, Japan. One of the best experiences about staying in a Ryokan is the full-course traditional Japanese cuisine they serve you for dinner. In total, our Kaiseki meal featured 11 courses of Japanese dishes.

All if all our Ryokan meal consisted of the following food/drink items:

1) Japanese fruit wine made with quince (fruity and floral)
2) Bento box 
3) chicken and cheese
4) mochi balls
5) mackerel fish 
6) green tofu with shrimp and pinenuts
7) pork with mushrooms and vegetables
8) White rice in a bowl
8) Japanese steamed Hida beef bun in a bamboo basket
9) Sashimi Bonito fish with ginger and grated radish
10) Shabu-shabu with vegetables, tofu and Hida beef meat and sesame sauce
11) Western-style course with Hida beef, brocolli, corn, sweet potato, pumpkin, potato with rice and 
12) pickles and miso soup 
13) Roasted green tea
Japanese desserts:
14) Milk pudding 
15) Fruit cake with a piece of pineapple

The presentation, attention to detail and the way everything was served made this Japanese dinner one of the most unique experiences we had during our trip to Japan. It was so much fun sitting down at a traditional Japanese table, wearing robes and being served course after course of delicious Japanese food. We'd highly recommend a Ryokan stay if you're visiting Japan.

Japan's oldest market is in Kochi prefecture (Shikoku) and has been going on for over 390 year. t started in the Edo period when a Feudal lord set it up so citizens could get everyday things for life like fruits and vegetables, clothes and blacksmith goods. Today, the tradition is the same. Farmers, bakers and craftsmen from all over Kochi drive into the city every Sunday morning before 5am to set up their stand to sell. Most vendors are seniors, some over 90 years old! 

Kochi Sunday Market is also famous for having very good vegan food options which is not very easy to find in Japan. 
Vegetarians will fare well here but vegan's must still ask about ingredients like dashi (fish soup stock used in cooking). 

★ INAKAZUSHI 田舎寿司
This is an amazing variety of vegetables sometimes fermented on a bed of rice like nigiri sushi. 
Vegetables you'll find include MYOGA (ginger), SHITAKE mushrooms, TAKE (bamboo sprouts), Konnyaku, RYUUKYUU Potato Steamed Stem 

We also eat 
▶︎ Deep fried sweet potato tempura
▶︎ Potato mochi with anko
▶︎ Kochi iced tomatoes
▶︎ Vegetable chips
▶︎ Yuzuaid (like lemonaid but - it's Yuzu)

He started eating baby food from when he was 5 months old and it started with rice porridge and ever since then the meals have been getting more intricate.

z3M2PKw3CFY,LIVE Fish Sashimi [ Ikizukuri ] | Weird Japanese Food - Eating LIVE Sashimi,"Siwar Planet
SUBSCRIBE
Ikizukuri, lit. ""prepared alive"", is the preparation of sashimi made from live seafood. Fish is usually used, but sometimes octopus, shrimp and lobster are used instead. The practice is controversial, and ikizukuri is outlawed in Australia and Germany.

Sashimi, the famous Japanese dish, describes raw seafood, usually fish, which is sliced into bite-sized bits. Eaten raw with soy sauce and wasabi, sashimi is always made out of the freshest of seafood of which Japan, surrounded by oceans, has an abundance. This is the reason why sashimi came to be in the first place.

The history of sashimi is somewhat shrouded in mysteries offering many theories on its origins. One says that it dates back to a dish of sliced raw fish and vegetables seasoned with vinegar called “namasu” that was eaten at the Japanese court during the Heian period. Another theory traces the roots of sashimi to the sliced fish that fishermen sold during the Kamakura period as a kind of fast food. While the delicacy was only available in coastal regions due to the lack of refrigeration methods, it can – and is – enjoyed everywhere in Japan today, both in restaurants and homes.

Next to the most representative sashimi fish, tuna, a large variety of seafood is used for making sashimi in Japan. Often used fish includes sea bream, flounder, and salmon. However, shrimp and squid, as well as different kinds of shellfish, also make for excellent sashimi. In general, more seafood sashimi is available than raw river fish like trout and carp.

Who am I?👩🏻‍⚕️🍙
I'm a first-year med student in Turkey. I'm taking a break from med school because of some personal and private reasons. I can not explain it yet but I will hopefully in the future.
If you are interested in which ethnicity do I have, I'm mixed. (Japanese-Turkish)
I was born in Japan but I grew up in Turkey. (But I visit Japan every single year)
Both of these languages are my mother language.
I’m polyglot and I can speak 4 languages fluently which are Japanese, Turkish, German, and English. If you don’t think that I’m a polyglot check Cambridge or Oxford Dictionary.
 Poly means multiple and glot mean tongue so yes I am :)
I will be planning to upload lots of productivity-related videos, so stay tuned if you like those types of videos.

Japanese cooking is tricky when it comes to find the right ingredients. 
For those who just started cooking Japanese food, this beginner's guide should be helpful. 
I'm holding a Japanese cooking class in Tokyo.
Many of my guests especially the expats who are currently living in Japan asked me to do the supermarket tour! If you go to Japanese supermarket, every label on the products is mostly in Japanese. You might encounter the struggle of what all this products are? Everything is totally new and you have to find out by using google translation to guide you. 
My goal here is to save your time and guide you to the easy directions at the supermarket!

As my first day in Brazil went on, my friends and I continued exploring the beautiful city of São Paulo. Join us as we go on a Brazilian Japanese food tour of the Liberdade area of São Paulo! 

My afternoon began in Liberdade, which is better known as the Japantown of the city. Brazil has the highest Japanese population outside of Japan, and a lot of them are right here in São Paulo! The first Japanese people arrived in Liberdade in 1908, and since then, it has become a community of Asian fusion, with people from China, South Korea, and other Asian nations settling there as well.

I couldn’t wait to go on this Japanese food tour and have some sake and takoyaki!

We passed by Kaisen Alimentos, which sells Takoyaki (octopus fritters), tempura, and okonomiyaki. But we started at a small shop called Restaurante Sato, which sells Brazilian-Japanese fusion. 

We got pork and beef that had both been marinated in miso and some beans and rice. I loved the beans, and the miso-marinated beef and pork had that salty soy flavor I love! Next, I tried some chili sauce with chilies and ginger on the pork. It had a slight tingle, but wasn’t too hot. The fusion of flavors was fantastic!

I also had some crunchy and juicy turnip before we headed to an izakaya, which is a Japanese bar that also sells food. Along the way, we stopped at Coffee Selfie, which is a café where they take your picture and print it on the foam of your coffee! My iced coffee was basically a Frappuccino and was delicious!

It was raining a bit as we headed back out. We passed more spots selling yummy-looking Japanese food and arrived at an izakaya called Izakaya Kintaro, which is owned by a family of sumo wrestlers. Inside, we ordered eggplant with miso, pork with ginger, and some sake.

The Pure Junmai sake was nice and smooth. I loved the eggplant, which had a potent ginger flavor. The pork was shredded with miso and onions and was so tasty! Each dish was $4, but the sake was $10 USD. They were delicious Brazilian tapas!

Next to the izakaya is a Hello Kitty store called Eat Asia that sells lots of snacks. They also sell shirts, dolls, and more. I headed upstairs, where they have cupcakes, cakes, cookies, and more. 

From there, we passed lots of stores and passed under a Japanese gate and crossed a bridge over the highway. There, you’ll find lots of souvenir vendors, and past the bridge is a beautiful Japanese garden, but it was closed. We also saw a couple of Japanese supermarkets, a subway station, the national bank (which looked like a Japanese temple), and street food vendors.

One of the vendors was selling sugarcane juice, and the other was making tempura. The sugarcane juice was Sao Paulo-style (mixed with pineapple) and is really sweet. Then, I tried some raw sugarcane and some sugarcane with lime, which is the Rio-style. I liked both, but the local style was my favorite!

Then, we went to Yoka, which makes pasteles, but they’re Japanese-style. I got the one with ground beef, tomatoes, cheese, and egg, which is their famous pastel. It’s crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved the egg inside and the spicy sauce I added. It was like a Colombian empanada!

We also had fritters made of shredded chicken, celery, and potatoes. It was similar to dishes I’ve had in Colombia. It was mushy and nice with the chili sauce, which added a nice kick.

Next, we went to Izakaya Issa to have some takoyaki and soju! The octopus fritters were topped with bonito flakes. It had a sweet sauce on top and was very soft with nice chunks of octopus inside. So good!

The soju is made from distilled sweet potatoes, so it’s a little sweet and a little stronger than sake.

Japanese Highway Service Areas or Rest Stops are quite amazing and in this episode we’ll look at one of them that has a food challenge! Tomobe SA in Ibaraki Prefecture has a restaurant that has taken the highest mountain in the area and turned it into a dish. Mount Tsukuba is 877 meters high, but as food, it looks steeper and more intimidating. 16 long cuts of grilled pork cutlets smothered in a savory sauce on a bed of shredded cabbage and rice weighing more than 1kg (2.2 lbs). It may not be as big as some food challenges like the 2.2kg (5 lbs) Monster Gyoza in failed to eat in 2014, but it is still an interesting dish. It costs 1700 Yen ($15) for the set with miso soup and some pickles. 
Eaters can simply order it from a vending machine and it takes about 5-7 minutes to prepare. 

Do you think you can take down Mount Tsukuba in meat?

Bluefin tuna is one of the most highly prized fish used in Japanese raw fish dishes. About 80% of the caught Atlantic and Pacific bluefin tunas are consumed in Japan. The fish is renowned for fetching high bids at the first auction of the year in Tokyo's Tsukiji Market. The world’s most expensive fish is the 222-kilogram bluefin tuna that sold for $1.8 Million (155.4 million yen) in January 2017.

In this video, a large tuna is separated into sections of differing grades and prepared into a delicious sushi meal.

Japanese began eating tuna sushi in the 1840s, when a large catch came into Edo [old Tokyo] one season. A chef marinated a few pieces in soy sauce and served it as nigiri sushi. At that time, these fish were nicknamed shibi — ""four days"" — because chefs would bury them for four days to mellow their bloody taste.

We’ve focused a bit on traditional food in Japan, but we’re really interested in seeing what new things creative chefs can imagine here in Japan.  So, we went out to Gion Roiro in the heart of Kyoto, where instead of highly traditional food, we had an eye-opening experience of new, creative dishes.

Thank you to Gion Roiro for inviting us out to shoot this video and to have free reign for shooting around the kitchen, which is hard to come by in many Japanese restaurants.  While this video was sponsored, we’re only posting it because we really liked what we ate, and we liked the shots we got too, and we think that you’ll really like it as well.

Nishiki Market started in 1310 as a fish market in Kyoto, but has evolved into a shopping street with over 100 stores, and is now one of the best places to try Kyoto street food! Today, Nishiki Market is considered the “Kitchen of Kyoto” and offers a range of seafood, sweets, pickles, tea, and more. 

Shizuka meets up with Kevin, a food tour guide in Kyoto, for an insightful stroll around Nishiki Market, tasting a variety of Kyoto street food and chatting about local specialties like tsukemono pickles and yuba (a type of “tofu skin”). Kevin talks about the history of Nishiki Market and even gives some tips about how to use yuba in home cooking.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to walk up and down every single aisle in a Japanese supermarket for 1 hour? Look no further! This video does just that. Come and explore the produce section! And the fish section! And even the bento section! Wait, is that the candy section? Does it ever end? You'll have to watch and find out! Why is this video so damn long?!?!
In all honesty, I'm sorry this video is so long. But I wanted to give the full experience and not cut out anything. Also, I made this video the way that I want, not how other people want or expect.
Feel free to pause the video and take a break and continue watching it later. You don't have to watch the entire video in one sitting.

The Pacific geoduck, scientific name Panopea generosa, is a species of very large, edible saltwater clam in the family Hiatellidae. The common name is derived from a Lushootseed (Nisqually) word gʷídəq.

The geoduck is native to the west coast of North America. The shell of the clam ranges from 15 centimetres (5.9 in) to over 20 centimetres (7.9 in) in length, but the extremely long siphons make the clam itself much longer than this: the ""neck"" or siphons alone can be 1 metre (3.3 ft) in length. The geoduck is the largest burrowing clam in the world. It is also one of the longest-living animals of any type, with a lifespan of up to 140 years; the oldest has been recorded at 168 years old.

The large, meaty siphon is prized for its savory flavor and crunchy texture. Geoduck is regarded by some as an aphrodisiac because of its phallic shape. It is very popular in China, where it is considered a delicacy,  mostly eaten cooked in a fondue-style Chinese hot pot. In Korean cuisine, geoducks are eaten raw with spicy chili sauce, sautéed, or in soups and stews. In Japan, geoduck is prepared as raw sashimi, dipped in soy sauce and wasabi. On Japanese menus in cheaper sushi restaurants, geoduck is sometimes substituted for Tresus keenae, a species of horse clam, and labeled mirugai or mirukuigai. It is considered to have a texture similar to an ark shell (known in Japanese as akagai). Mirugai is sometimes translated into English as ""giant clam"", and it is distinguished from himejako sushi, which is made from Tridacna gigas.

If you're looking for a fun place to eat, go to Hirobun. It's in a beautiful and peaceful area where the noodles flow in a long bamboo stick with clear and cold running water through it. But you have to be fast and on your guard for your noodles because they slide by pretty quick!

Then tried out some cool Samurai food that was once eaten by actual Samurai's. For Samurai's to stay healthy and fit they ate a lot of vegetables, and I thought it was pretty good, although I don't really eat veggies. And to end my fun food day, I went to grab some Okonomu-Yaki. I have to say Manmaru No Tsuki served up some amazing foods here.

Maki sushi recipe - japanese food recipe - four seasons sushi roll  
http://makesushi.org/sushi-gallery  

The four season's sushi roll is a stunning roll to look at; the beauty lies in its simplicity. The sushi roll is made up of only 5 ingredient's ; Nori, sushi grade salmon, avocado, sushi grade tuna and cooked seasoned sushi rice. This is probably the easiest maki roll to make since all you have to do is, cut the ingredients in to rectangular shapes and then assemble them, the most difficult part is the cut the avocado in to a series of pieces that as a whole make a rectangle, but even this is easy once you get going.

JAPANESE OMKASE SUSHI Dinner in Taiwan at SUSHI 27!!

Today we bring you a special video, trying a very authentic Japanese Omakase at a legendary spot in Taiwan - Sushi 27 which is extremely hard to book (thanks Tony!). We taste over 27 different dishes and the chef teaches us about each piece.

What sets Sushi 27 apart from other sushi restaurants is that the chef experimentally ages each type of fish differently. You can taste the distinct differences, rather than every piece tasting fresh. The chef's rice is extremely flavourful as well. Another thing that sets Sushi 27 apart is that the chef gets most of his ingredients from Toyosu Fish Market (formerly Tsukiji Fish Market). He is among the top ranking sushi chefs in all of Taiwan, and high ranking among Japanese sushi chefs as well!

Japan is a country of convenience, and if you have a car, you'll find loads of restaurants outside the cities offering drive thru service. 
What's unique is more than the food - sushi, ramen, gyudon, fast food - it's the reason why Japanese go to a drive thru. 
So, who are the customers that visit Japanese drive thru? 

★ Families with children so they can stay in their car
★ Easy Take Away Pickup to eat at home
★ The disabled who can't enter the restaurant

Nearly all people take the food home to be eaten and don't eat in their cars according to restaurant owners.

6.61M subscribers

Omurice or omu-rice (オムライス Omu-raisu) is an example of yōshoku (a Western-influenced style of Japanese cuisine) consisting of an omelette made with fried rice and usually topped with ketchup. With omu and raisu being contractions of the words omelette and rice, the name is an example of Gairaigo. It is a popular dish both commonly cooked at home and often found at western style diners in Japan. The dish was brought to Korea during Japanese rule, and today it is a fixture on gimbap restaurant menus throughout South Korea, where it is rendered as ""오므라이스 (omeuraiseu)"" in Hangul. Omurice is also popular in Taiwan, another territory formerly occupied by Japan. Children, in particular, enjoy omurice, and it is often featured in okosama-ranchi or kids' meals.

Omurice is said to have originated around the turn of the 20th century at a western style restaurant in Tokyo's Ginza district called Renga-tei, inspired by chakin-zushi.

It has been featured in popular culture such as the Japanese film Tampopo and the Korean TV series Rooftop Prince, and more recently in the manga Shokugeki no Soma.

Tamagoyaki is a type of Japanese omelette, which is made by rolling together several layers of cooked egg. These usually are prepared in a rectangular omelette pan called a makiyakinabe.

There are several types of tamagoyaki. It is made by combining eggs, and sometimes sugar or soy sauce. Additionally, sake and mirin are used in some recipes. 

Tamagoyaki is served around the world in the form of nigiri, and also appears in many types of sushi rolls. In Japan, it is also served as a breakfast dish and in other preparations. As part of a sushi/sashimi dinner tamago is usually taken as the final course, in essence a dessert bite.

In Japanese, it's 卵焼き or 玉子焼き, literally ""grilled egg"", also called tamago or dashimaki (Dashimaki Tamago ダシ巻き玉子焼).

Top 10 Japanese Street Food Tour in Kyoto Japan. Food Guide in Nishiki Market and Gion Area, walking street food tour to my top 10 favorite street food spots.  Nishiki Market is known as Kyoto’s kitchen and it’s been around for 400 years. And one of the main reasons why Nishiki Market opened up here in Kyoto is because this very spot run clean and cold groundwater which was used a refrigeration system by shop owners back in the day.  Now there about 129 stores crammed in this narrow 400 meter market and it’s equally crowded with locals and tourists alike.   Many Japan tourists and Japan travelers are looking for the best food market spots at Nishki and I cover some of the best shops  We try the famous Tako Tamago which is an Octopus with a quail egg inside.  We also try Tamagoyaki at Kai, which is a fluffy and elegant tasting Dashimaki Tamago made only with their High-end Kyoto eggs. Dashimaki Tamago is a type of Tamagoyaki but uses a Dashi soup and is usually not sweet. Also on the menu for this Kyoto Street Food tour are Oysters, Fishcakes, Grilled Fish, Cheese Tart, Fried Chicken Karaage, Black Ramen and Melon Pan Ice Cream.

This is Japan Food Travel Guide for Japan tourists and and Kyoto travelers.  So many things to see and eat in Kyoto, but I wanted to give everyone a Kyoto Street food guide on Things to do in Kyoto and where to eat in Kyoto.  

Nishiki Market (錦市場 Nishiki Ichiba) (literally ""brocade market"") is a marketplace in downtown Kyoto, located on a road one block north and parallel to Shijō Street (四条通 Shijō-dōri) and west of Teramachi Street (寺町通 Teramachi-dōri). Rich with history and tradition, the market is renowned as the place to obtain many of Kyoto's famous foods and goods.

Gion is Kyoto’s geisha district, with hostesses in colorful kimonos often sighted on the wooden Tatsumi Bridge, or amid upscale Japanese restaurants and boutiques on Hanamikoji Street.

■Watch this video to understand the deliciousness of the traditional Japanese food Grilled Eel (Unagi). Please experience Grilled Eel (Unagi) in a simulated manner.

【Explanation of Japanese food Grilled Eel (Unagi)】
It is a Japanese food made by putting eel kabayaki on rice in a heavy box and sprinkling it with sauce (mirin soy sauce, etc.), and it is often sprinkled with Japanese pepper powder (effect to help digestion) or with eel liver sucking. Eel rice (eel rice) in a heavy box.
　
It may be written in the menu in descending order of price, such as pine, bamboo, plum, etc., and ranks according to the size, amount, part of kabayaki, and whether the eel is natural or farmed (type of domestic or imported product). There seems to be a division.

It seems that the price of Unadon tends to be higher than that of Unadon, but the quality and quantity are different depending on the size of kabayaki and the presence or absence of liver sucking, etc., and the container is different (such as Unadon for lunch). It seems that it depends on the store, such as the same place.

Let's study Grilled Eel (Unagi) by watching this video!

kvLv0Ne7-aU,japanese street food - okonomiyaki,"Siglex
199K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Okonomiyaki  o-konomi-yaki is a Japanese savory pancake containing a variety of ingredients. The name is derived from the word okonomi, meaning ""how you like"" or ""what you like"", and yaki meaning ""grill"". Okonomiyaki is mainly associated with the Kansai or Hiroshima areas of Japan, but is widely available throughout the country. Toppings and batters tend to vary according to region. In Tokyo, there is a semi-liquid okonomiyaki called 'monjayaki.'
Kansai- or Osaka-style okonomiyaki is the predominant version of the dish, found throughout most of Japan. The batter is made of flour, grated nagaimo (a type of yam), water or dashi, eggs and shredded cabbage, and usually contains other ingredients such as green onion, meat (generally thin pork belly, often mistaken for bacon), octopus, squid, shrimp, vegetables, konjac, mochi or cheese. Okonomiyaki is sometimes compared to an omelette or a pancake and may be referred to as a ""Japanese pizza"" or ""Osaka soul food""
Some okonomiyaki restaurants are grill-it-yourself establishments, where the server produces a bowl of raw ingredients that the customer mixes and grills at tables fitted with teppan, or special hotplates. They may also have a diner-style counter where the cook prepares the dish in front of the customers.
In Osaka (the largest city in the Kansai region), where this dish is said to have originated, okonomiyaki is prepared much like a pancake. The batter and other ingredients are pan-fried on both sides on either a teppan or a pan using metal spatulas that are later used to slice the dish when it has finished cooking. Cooked okonomiyaki is topped with ingredients that include otafuku/okonomiyaki sauce (similar to Worcestershire sauce but thicker and sweeter), aonori (seaweed flakes), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger (beni shoga).

This is Tokyo life working in Japan at a Japanese Ramen Shop as a Ramen Chef.  Japanese workers are often portrayed as Salarymen but in this video we focus on Japanese food services industry and what it is like to work in a Japanese restaurant.  This is a day in the life of a Japanese Chef, Tetsuya, 41 years old, working in Japan at a ramen store, karashibi miso ramen Kinkanbo.  It's a popular spicy ramen shop in Tokyo Japan serving a devil ramen.  We see Japanese working hours as well as Japanese workers in a Tokyo ramen restaurant, a peek into Japanese life.  Tetsuya starts the day in his apartment and as an average Japanese worker, he commutes to work in Tokyo via train.  It only takes him 20 minutes to get to work, but soon after arriving, he's busy working at the Japanese food restaurant and preparing Japanese ramen noodles for customers.  His main duty is the manager of the ramen shop, but he also creates new gentei limited time menu items as a Japanese ramen chef.  Life in Tokyo is amazing and part of this is because we have dedicated workers in Japan that keep the city running.  To be a Japanese chef you must really have a passion for what  you do.  If you are ever looking for a spicy food challenge or spicy ramen challenge in Tokyo, then the Kikanbo ramen shop should be you first destination.  But don't worry, if you can't eat spicy ramen, the ramen shop also prepares non-spicy version of the ramen bowl.  Customers can choose their level of spiciness from low all the way to Oni level, aka Devil ramen. Enjoy this Japanese food tour of a Japanese ramen shop.

VHVZtf8vdeE,Japanese Inn & Kaiseki Cuisine: The Ryokan Stay Experience,"WAO RYU!ONLY in JAPAN
1.41M subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
A Traditional Japanese Inn stay can be the highlight of any trip to Japan, and this comprehensive tour of 13 hot spring towns will give you a complete picture of what to expect during a stay. From the tatami room to the kitchen and dining room, this is the story of the Ryokan. 

After 20 years living in Japan, a Ryokan stay is the most authentic experience one can have traveling the country and Fukushima, Japan's third largest prefecture, is famous for that countryside charm and service found around its mountains. It's only a 75 minute Shinkansen train ride from Tokyo making it an ideal getaway from more crowded spots like Nikko and Hakone. In this video, you will see exactly what you will get from start to finish. 

As Japan moves closer to the 2020 Olympics, services are catering more to international visitors and these hotels featured are all accommodating and friendly places, staff learning English to communicate with people from around the world. 

▶︎ What is Kaiseki Ryori / Cuisine?

It's a traditional Japanese dinner with many courses including a starter, soup, side items, main course and dessert. 
★ Sashimi / Sushi
★ Sukiyaki
★ Yakiniku
★ Tempura
★ Miso Soup
It's all here, and it's all prepared with local ingredients of the season, always freshly made in the kitchen.

▶︎ How much is a night at a Ryokan / Traditional Japanese Inn?

It is usually charged by the person instead of the room because it includes 2 meals, dinner and breakfast. On average, I have spent between 12,000 yen ($100) to 22,000 ($180) per person for a night and here is why it is worth it. 
Of all the experiences you will have in Japan, this will be the one you remember the most, dressing in a cotton kimono (yukata) to walk down to dinner, bathing outdoors in a hot spring in the snow, extraordinary Japanese service, amazingly beautiful meals ... you're paying for an experience not just a stay.

6.61M subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Teppanyaki is a style of Japanese cuisine that uses an iron griddle to cook food. The word teppanyaki is derived from teppan, which means iron plate, and yaki, which means grilled, broiled, or pan-fried. In Japan, teppanyaki refers to dishes cooked using an iron plate, including steak, shrimp, okonomiyaki, yakisoba, and monjayaki.

Modern teppanyaki grills are typically propane-heated flat surface grills and are widely used to cook food in front of guests at restaurants. With a solid griddle type cook surface, the teppanyaki is more suitable for smaller ingredients, such as rice, egg, and finely chopped vegetables.

This variety of sushi is a lost art and unknown outside Japan. The elaborate designs and use of the ingredients create beauty from food. This is SAIKU SUSHI and was quite popular in the Showa era but has sadly disappeared. Today, Yuki Sugeta and his sushi apprentice Issei Meguro from Takasago Sushi in Tokyo will prepare over a dozen designs of sushi in the shape of seasonal flowers, fish and animals like 75 years ago. When you eat sushi, you're not just eating raw fish on rice - you're eating the years of experience each chef has practiced their craft, perfecting it so you come back for more. 

Tokyo's Sushi restaurants are competitive, I'll be back not just because the sushi is excellent - it is - but because the chef is friendly - and speaks a little English too :)

I am an artist residing in sunny, warm [humid] florida! My paintings are heavily inspired by nature and its beauty. I work primarily in oil paint, and sometimes watercolor. I prefer to work in a mostly realistic style and occasionally experiment outside of that. I post oil painting time lapses, painting lessons and tutorials, drawings, art tips, and occasionally artist vlogs where I share bits of my life as an artist. Creating art is my greatest passion and I'm thankful for the chance to share it with you. ♥

Hey! So today I wanted to try something a little different. I've been noticing several people trying ""painting with wool"" recently and I really wanted to take the chance to give it a try as well. Basically it is just needle felting, but on a flat surface. So you create this kind of fuzzy art piece that's really cool. I am a complete beginner with needle felting, but this was perfect for easing into it. This was a surprisingly easy art project to jump into and learn from scratch. Also, I had a lot of fun and ended up with some super cute little creations.

Meet German-born artist Ursula Reuter Christiansen in her studio in Denmark and learn more about her practice and an artistic career of more than fifty years – and counting. Reuter Christiansen takes us from her roots in the German town Trier and all the way up to her most recent, large-scale action paintings. On the way, we stop in front of a handful of works from the artist’s enormous production.

Reuter Christiansen talks about influences from Catholicism, literature, romanticism, mannerism, politics, female role models, and peers in her youth such as Markus Lüpertz, Jörg Immendorff, Imi Knoebel, and Sigmar Polke – and the decisive influence from professor Joseph Beuys, whom she studied under at the Kunstakademie Dusseldorf in the mid-1960’s. 

The use of different materials in creating artworks that have a strong physical, sensual presence is at the heart of the artist’s production. “I'm not the type to have a little easel and fiddle with a brush”, she notes, and shares one of her most recent works where the political substance is formed with paint, bodily action and raw eggs.

The video opens with a passage from Reuter Christiansen’s text “Fast pictures” (1983): ""Fast pictures, hasty pictures, scrawled pictures, impatient pictures, mirror pictures, desperate pictures, amorous pictures, revealing pictures, superficial pictures, mad pictures, never: nice, comfortable, thoroughly prepared, sweet-smelling, conciliatory pictures. All I can say is that I HAVE PAINTED THEM! … These pictures are true curiosities. Look at them, dammit!""

Ursula Reuter Christiansen (b. 1943) is a German-born artist, based in Denmark since 1969 when she graduated from Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and married Danish artist and composer Henning Christiansen (1932-2008). Reuter Christiansen has exhibited widely. In 2001, she represented Denmark at the Venice Biennale with Henning Christiansen. She has participated in group exhibitions such as WACK! Art and the feminist revolution at MOCA in Los Angeles and MOMA PS1 in New York in 2007-08. Recent museum solo exhibitions were held at SMK National Gallery of Denmark and MdbK Leipzig. Reuter Christiansen has served as a professor at HFBK Hamburg and The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. For more information on the artist see:

BR Turner ART

The funnel is one of the best ways to get UNREAL CELLS! Definitely need silicone oil for this technique! I love the results I get from this technique! You can too! All you need is acrylic paint mixed with floetrol and a few drops of silicone oil plus a funnel and you’re go to go! 

All my mixtures stay the same at roughly 1/4 paint to floetrol ratio. I add 2-3 drops of silicone oil per cup.

WELCOME to my fluid art channel! I'm calling today's painting ""Marianas""- it's a bloom swipe on a 10"" X 30"" pre-used canvas with what I imagine to be some of the flora and fauna that may live in the Marianas Trench. Guessing they create their own sunlight and may not look like recognizable life to us...

Pop Muzik was one of the first new wave singles to top the charts. The singles popularity was bolstered by this catchy video that featured Scott as a DJ singing from behind turntables, and flanked by two female models providing the additional vocals... Or do they? One of the sight gags in the video depicted Brigit Novik dressed in blue who actually recorded the backup vocals which were mimed by the models. The song went on to have global success and had ""everybody talkin' 'bout Pop Muzik"". The original clip from1979. Boogie in a suitcase. Pop, pop, pop muzik.

TROLLS WORLD TOUR – Available on-demand now!

Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake return in an all-star sequel to DreamWorks Animation’s 2016 musical hit: Trolls World Tour. In an adventure that will take them well beyond what they’ve known before, Poppy (Kendrick) and Branch (Timberlake) discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands and devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder.

A member of hard-rock royalty, Queen Barb (Rachel Bloom), aided by her father King Thrash (Ozzy Osbourne), wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends — Biggie (James Corden), Chenille (Caroline Hjelt), Satin (Aino Jawo), Cooper (Ron Funches) and Guy Diamond (Kunal Nayyar) — set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who’s looking to upstage them all.

Cast as members of the different musical tribes is one the largest, and most acclaimed, groups of musical talent ever assembled for an animated film. From the land of Funk are Mary J. Blige, George Clinton and Anderson .Paak. Representing Country is Kelly Clarkson as Delta Dawn, with Sam Rockwell as Hickory and Flula Borg as Dickory. J Balvin brings Reggaeton, while Ester Dean adds to the Pop tribe. Anthony Ramos brings the beat in Techno and Jamie Dornan covers smooth jazz. World-renowned conductor and violinist Gustavo Dudamel appears as Trollzart and Charlyne Yi as Pennywhistle from the land of Classical. And Kenan Thompson raps as a hip-hop newborn Troll named Tiny Diamond.

Trolls World Tour is directed by Walt Dohrn, who served as co-director on Trolls, and is produced by returning producer Gina Shay. The film is co-directed by David P. Smith and co-produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella, both of whom worked on the first Trolls. Trolls World Tour will also feature original music by Justin Timberlake, who earned an Oscar® nomination for his song for 2016’s Trolls, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!,” and a score by Theodore Shapiro (2016’s Ghostbusters, The Devil Wears Prada).

☕ About Cafe Music BGM channel
We are making Cafe music for relaxation, for work, for study, etc.
All music in this video & in this channel is original music by us.
We are playing all the songs.

📜 What is BGMC?
Morning.
Gentle light that shines through the blinds
One glass of water after waking up
The tender breeze from the window that we feel with all our body

These things are too ordinary in everyday life to be conscious.
But we can't live even if one of them is missing.
""BGMC - BGM channel"" has been providing music, hoping to be like them.

Though it is colorless and transparent, we want to make the listener's daily life as colorful as possible.
That is the essence of the music we deliver.

Light, water, wind, and BGMC
A new value for music.

As growing influence of american pop music in india, many young indians want to become a pop singer as lady gaga,taylor swift , adele, beyonce etc. BUT record labels in india do not sign artists who sing or produce english music which tends to make it difficult for young indian artists to get their talent recognised so in this video I am providing details that how you become a pop singer and get recognised without external help of any record label.

Great for all purpose! Also great for how to video timers, challenge timer, event timer, timer clock and more! So what is a countdown you may ask, well in the dictionary, countdown is definited as: a number to mark the time remaining before an event; also : preparations carried on during such a count. An easier way of defining it is: the process of counting off backward in fixed units (as seconds) the time remaining before an event. Also, a timer is: a clocklike device that turns something on or off at a set time or gives a signal at the end of a period of time. We can also relate this to a clock, hourglass, metronome, timepiece. Things associated to countdowns and timers are: pendulum, stopwatch, sundial, ticker, timekeeper, timemarker, watch, chronometer, chronograph, timepiece!

8.89M subscribers

TROLLS WORLD TOUR – Available on-demand now!

Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake return in an all-star sequel to DreamWorks Animation’s 2016 musical hit: Trolls World Tour. In an adventure that will take them well beyond what they’ve known before, Poppy (Kendrick) and Branch (Timberlake) discover that they are but one of six different Troll tribes scattered over six different lands and devoted to six different kinds of music: Funk, Country, Techno, Classical, Pop and Rock. Their world is about to get a lot bigger and a whole lot louder.

A member of hard-rock royalty, Queen Barb (Rachel Bloom), aided by her father King Thrash (Ozzy Osbourne), wants to destroy all other kinds of music to let rock reign supreme. With the fate of the world at stake, Poppy and Branch, along with their friends — Biggie (James Corden), Chenille (Caroline Hjelt), Satin (Aino Jawo), Cooper (Ron Funches) and Guy Diamond (Kunal Nayyar) — set out to visit all the other lands to unify the Trolls in harmony against Barb, who’s looking to upstage them all.

Cast as members of the different musical tribes is one the largest, and most acclaimed, groups of musical talent ever assembled for an animated film. From the land of Funk are Mary J. Blige, George Clinton and Anderson .Paak. Representing Country is Kelly Clarkson as Delta Dawn, with Sam Rockwell as Hickory and Flula Borg as Dickory. J Balvin brings Reggaeton, while Ester Dean adds to the Pop tribe. Anthony Ramos brings the beat in Techno and Jamie Dornan covers smooth jazz. World-renowned conductor and violinist Gustavo Dudamel appears as Trollzart and Charlyne Yi as Pennywhistle from the land of Classical. And Kenan Thompson raps as a hip-hop newborn Troll named Tiny Diamond.

Trolls World Tour is directed by Walt Dohrn, who served as co-director on Trolls, and is produced by returning producer Gina Shay. The film is co-directed by David P. Smith and co-produced by Kelly Cooney Cilella, both of whom worked on the first Trolls. Trolls World Tour will also feature original music by Justin Timberlake, who earned an Oscar® nomination for his song for 2016’s Trolls, “Can’t Stop the Feeling!,” and a score by Theodore Shapiro (2016’s Ghostbusters, The Devil Wears Prada).

_tjFwcmHy5M,Pop Music is Stuck on Repeat | Colin Morris | TEDxPenn,"TEDx Talks
31.4M subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Using foundational computer science theories, Colin Morris focuses on understanding trends in popular music. Borrowing from the areas of bioinformatics and compression algorithms, he shows that the lyrics of pop songs have become substantially more repetitive over the decades. Having established that, Morris tries to convince listeners that this is actually a good thing. He traces repetition in pop lyrics back to its poetic roots, and shows that, rather than being formulaic and recycled, repetitive songs show fascinating diversity. He suggests listeners stop thinking about repetitive earworms as guilty pleasures, and instead think of them as virtuous ones. Colin Morris is a data scientist and educator based in Toronto with a Master's in Computational Linguistics. His work often involves applying computational techniques to the analysis and appreciation of popular music. Most recently, he has analyzed trends in lyrical repetition of hit songs. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at

610K subscribers

There were so many sounds you could dance to and it all rose to a fevered pitch in the summer of 1979. Pop, disco, R&B, rock and New Wave seemed to have so much more importance on radio, but the reality was that vinyl sales hit an all time low during this time. Why? Well, after the juggernaut success of ""Saturday Night Fever"", many vinyl pressers stopped producing anything else but that soundtrack in order to meet demand. This would lead to depleted stocks of other popular recording until they could be reprinted and sent to retailers. Not sure of the real reason, I mean with disco so popular and the birth of the 12"", how could that be? I will figure it out someday. Out of the blue comes this elecronically charged tune that extolled the virtues of pop music with a new wave attitude by an artist with a single letter as a name, M. M was English musician Robin Scott who born April 1, 1947, He found he had a talent for writing and performing his music in the late 60's sharing the bill with David Bowie in an early incarnation. He expanded in to multimedia projects in 1970, then worked with Terry Britten (Tina Turner). He worked with several bands and then took to producing punk rock recordings by Adam & The Ants among others on his own Do It Records. On his own, be started on songs that would eventually comprise his biggest seller ever. Setting up shop in Montreux, Switzerland he began recording. One song he knew could be a hit was ""Pop Muzik"" and the song was initially recorded in R&B and funk styles before a friend of Scott suggested using synthesisers. Scott has said ""I was looking to make a fusion of various styles which somehow would summarise the last 25 years of pop music. It was a deliberate point I was trying to make. Whereas rock and roll had created a generation gap, disco was bringing people together on an enormous scale. That's why I really wanted to make a simple, bland statement, which was, 'All we're talking about basically (is) pop music.'"" He could have never guessed how completely he would succeed.

Saudi Arabia is gearing up to host The MDL Beast, the largest pop music festival in its history, featuring DJs David Guetta and Martin Garrix.

The Kingdom has been staging pop concerts and other cultural shows since last year, as part of a dramatic social reform program that has also seen women allowed to drive, cinemas opened, tourism visas introduced, dress codes relaxed and restrictions on live music and drama removed.

The MDL Beast festival is scheduled for December 19 to 21 in Banban, a district in north Riyadh. Several Twitter users expressed their excitement about the festival.

WF52WRtkV,The Hidden History of Pop Music | Matthias Mauch | TEDxGoodenoughCollege,"TEDx Talks
31.4M subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Everyone has an opinion on music; people enjoy it daily all around the world. Matthias Mauch enjoys it too, but he also likes to look at it from a slightly different perspective. By using quantitative analyses, he looks a little closer on what is actually happening in popular music during the last 50 years. His analyses show remarkable findings in the structure and diversity of music. It is almost like looking at music with a pair of evolutionary biologist eyes…well…that IS what he eventually did - he utilised selection, recombination and mutation, to explain the evolution of music.

Matthias Mauch is a researcher in music informatics. As an undergraduate mathematics student in Rostock, Germany, he earned his pocket money as an amateur musician. Combining his passions for maths and music he went on to do a Ph.D. in electronic engineering at Queen Mary University of London – on algorithms to automatically transcribe chords from music recordings.

After a post-doc in Japan and a Research Fellowship at Last.fm returned to Queen Mary in 2012 on a Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship, investigating music signal processing, human singing, and the evolution of musical style. He’s published over 40 peer-reviewed conference and journal papers.

Together with his research collaborators from Imperial College London he’s a recipient of a 2012 Cozzarelli Prize for scientific excellence and originality from the National Academy of Sciences of the USA.

This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at

Ami6WGQ318E,Delhi HC Fines Juhi Chawla & Co Rs 20 Lakh For Plea Against 5G; Raps Her For Sharing Link,"Republic World

#JuhiChawla #5G #DelhiHC #RepublicTV 

Quashing the plea filed by Juhi Chawla against the implementation of 5G mobile technology in India, the Delhi High Court on Friday imposed a fine of Rs 20 lakh against the Bollywood actor and her co-petitioners. The High Court observed that the lawsuit had been filed for 'publicity' and that the petitioner i.e. Juhi Chawla had filed 'vexatious avernments' of which she had no knowledge. 

Noting that the plea is not 'maintainable' in law, the High Court also slammed Juhi Chawla for sharing the link of the live hearing to gain 'publicity'. The Court said that it had caused 'immense disturbance' during the hearing and asked Delhi police to identify the person who disrupted the hearing. This comes after an anonymous person crashed the Delhi High Court hearing against the implementation of 5G mobile technology in India and sang songs from old Juhi Chawla films. 

The man reportedly sang thrice at different intervals, prompting Justice JR Midha to direct the authorities to find out who the person as he was removed. Notably, Juhi Chawla herself took to Instagram and posted the link for the virtual hearing, inviting people to join the hearing. Significantly, the High Court has issued a notice against those who joined the hearing in an unauthorised capacity.

▶Song Details:
Featuring: KSHMR
Produced By: KSHMR
Written By: Armaan Malik, Eric Nam, Natania Lalwani, KSHMR, Jeroen Sjoers & Jord Brinkhuis
Label: Armaan Malik



▶Lyrics:-
[Verse 1: Armaan Malik]
Worlds apart
You're standing in front of me
But you're so far
It's getting hard (yeah)
To think of the reasons
We stay in the dark
Would it be for the better
If we both just surrender
And let it go? (Let it go)
Being with each other is breaking our hearts

[Chorus: Armaan Malik]
Tell me what we're fighting for
And is it really worth the battles
We've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo, echo
I hurt you then you hold me close
We get off on thе highs and lows
Yeah, we've been going back and forth
Likе an echo, echo, echo, echo

[Post-Chorus: Armaan Malik]
Like an echo, echo, echo, echo
Like an echo, echo, echo, echo

[Verse 2: Eric Nam]
Some twisted game
I want you so bad
Yet I push you away
Repeat mistakes
At some point we thought
Love would conquer the pain
Your eyes, they look like heaven
We use love as a weapon
We're insane
Tearing each other apart every day

[Chorus: Eric Nam]
So tell me what we're fighting for
And is it really worth the battles
We've been going back and forth
Like an echo, echo, echo, echo
I hurt you then you hold me close
We get off on the highs and lows
Yeah, we've been going back and forth
Like an echo, echo, echo, echo

[Post-Chorus]
Like an echo, echo, echo, echo
(We've been going back and forth)
Like an echo, echo, echo, echo

[Chorus: Armaan Malik, Eric Nam]
Tell me what we're fighting for
And is it really worth the battles
We've been going back and forth
Like an echo echo, echo, echo
I hurt you then you hold me close
We get off on the highs and lows
Yeah, we've been going back and forth
Like an echo, echo, echo, echo

[Outro]
Is it really worth the battles
Echo echo, echo, echo
Is it really worth the battles
Echo echo, echo, echo

Lyrics :
Ishq jaise hai ik aandhi
Ishq hai ik toofaan
Ishq ke aage bebas hai
Duniya mein har ilzaam
Ishq mein sab diwaane hain
Ishq mein sab hairaan
Ishq mein sab kuch mushkil
Hai ishq mein sab aasaan
Dekho pyaare ye nazaare
Ye diwaane ye parwaane
Ye ishq mein kaise gum


Haay! Tumse milke dil
Ka hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen
Tumse milke dil ka
Hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen


Dhum tara dhum tara

Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara dhumma
Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara hum


Dil toh ik raahi jaana
Dil ki tum manzil ho
Dil toh hai ik kashti
Jaana jiska tum saahil ho
Dil na phir kuch maange
Jaana tum agar haasil ho
Dil toh hai mera tanha
Jaana aao toh mehfil ho


Ishq se hi saari khushiyaan
Ishq hi barbaadi
Ishq hai paabandi
Lekin ishq hi azaadi
Ishq ki duniya mein
Yaaron khwaab ki aabaadi
Ho gaya woh jisko
Manzil ishq ye dikhlaadi
Dekho pyaare ye nazaare
Ye diwaane ye parwaane
Ye ishq mein kaise gum


Haay! Tumse milke dil
Ka hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen
Tumse milke dil ka hai
Jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa ye
Kamaal kya kahen


Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara dhumma
Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara
Dhum tara dhum tara hum


Tumko puja hai tumhaari
Hi ibaadat kee hai
Hamne jab kee hai toh
Phir aise mohabbat kee hai
Hamne jab kee hai toh
Phir aise mohabbat kee hai
Dil mera paagal hai
Jaana isko tum behlaado
Dil mein kyun halchal hai
Jaana mujhko tum samjhaado
Dil ka jo aanchal hai
Jaana isko tum lehraado
Zulf jo baadal hai jaana
Mujhpe tum barsaado
Jaana leke jaaya hai
Tera ye diwaana
Jaan tujhpe mit jaayega
Tera ye parwaana
Jaana mere dil mein
Kya hai tumne ye na jaana
Jaana tujhko yaad
Aayega mera ye afsaana


Dekho pyaare ye nazaare
Ye diwaane ye parwaane
Ye ishq mein kaise gum


Haay! Tumse milke dil ka
Hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen
Tumse milke dil ka
Hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen

 ओ मेरे दिल के चैन 
चलते चलते मेरे ये गीत 
छूकर मेरे मन को 
यह जो मोहब्बत है 
आते जाते खूबसूरत 
ये शाम मस्तानी 
दिल लगी ने दी हवा 
दिल क्या करे जब किसी से 
दिलबर मुझे कब तक मुझे 
मार गई मुझे तेरी जुदाई 
आपकी आंखों में महके हुए से 
आप यहां आए

Bollywood songs, more formally known as Hindi film songs or filmi songs, are songs featured in Bollywood films. Derived from the song-and-dance routines common in Indian films, Bollywood songs, along with dance, are a characteristic motif of Hindi cinema which gives it enduring popular appeal, cultural value and context. Hindi film songs form a predominant component of Indian pop music, and derive their inspiration from both classical and modern sources. Hindi film songs are now firmly embedded in North India's popular culture and routinely encountered in North India in marketplaces, shops, during bus and train journeys and numerous other situations. Though Hindi films routinely contain many songs and some dance routines, they are not musicals in the Western theatrical sense; the music-song-dance aspect is an integral feature of the genre akin to plot, dialogue and other parameters.



1990s – The decade of celebration
As 1980s drew to a close, the softness and subtle nuances of these songs began giving way to fast and orchestral forms too. A portion of the 1990s also introduced us to the three Khans, Madhuri Dixit, Karisma Kapoor and others. There was dance, a lot of it! There were celebrations too as onscreen romance became more fearless. There was open flirting as guys and girls broke into a dance number at the drop of a hat. Luckily, all of it never looked jarring. Sooraj Barjatya’s films seemed written around a dozen of songs with the plot connecting each number. There was DDLJ too which was a mixed bag of tracks – one for party, one for shaadi and one for the ‘sarson ke khet’ too! And among all of it, its manner of picturisation also changed with more proximity between the actors. Now, there wasn’t any need for any cut-ins as actors were close enough to fit in the single frame!





2000s – The decade of quick moves

In the 2000s, there was increasing skin show, quick moves and loud compositions. New faces like Hrithik Roshan and Aishwarya Rai added to the star value. Both being brilliant dancers with beautiful personalities shone onscreen. No film was complete without their dance number. And while these two filled up for the performance part, others like Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan kept the romance intact. While SRK kept spreading his arms, Aamir’s antics in tracks like “Aati Kya Khandala” even if it lacked lyrics, made each of their song a national favourite. And amid all this, filmmakers like Karan Johar kept giving us Kabhie Khushi Kabhi Gham to fix any loose ends.

Sometimes the songs were used to introduce a character, sometimes, in the end credits to show the “happily ever after”. They were all shot larger than life on a budget which could be enough to produce a separate film altogether. This phase saw the canvas of songs grow to exorbitant levels.




2010s – The decade of objectification

In 2010s, songs lost their storytelling part too. Its screenplay wasn’t really worked upon. All our actors had to do was get into some gymnastic-like dance, which was fast cut on the editing table. And before you could see their faces or judge their moves, the shot had changed 5 times! Romance too became indulging in the actual ‘act’. Suggestive shots and symbolism vanished and Bollywood began propagating “see it to believe it”.

Jab Main Badal Ban Jaaun
Tum Bhi Baarish Ban Jana
Jo Kam Pad Jaaye Saansein
Tu Mera Dil Ban Jaana
Rim Jhim Sawan Ki Boondein
Tu Har Mausam Barsana
Jo Kam Pad Jaaye Saansein
Tu Mera Dil Ban Jana
Mere Labon Se Aaye Kabhi Bhi
Ho Naam Pehla Tera Meri Zubaan Pe
Chahe Zamana Munh Mod Le Par
Har Pal Tu Rehna Mera
Bas Yeh Dua Hai
Bana Lungi Main Ab
Tujhe Hi Khuda
Jab Main Badal Ban Jaaun
Tum Bhi Baarish Ban Jaana
Jo Kam Pad Jaaye Saansein
Tu Mera Dil Ban Jana
Rim Jhim Sawan Ki Boondein
Tu Har Mausam Barsana
Jo Kam Pad Jaaye Saansein
Tu Mera Dil Ban Jana

Lyrics :
Ishq jaise hai ik aandhi
Ishq hai ik toofaan
Ishq ke aage bebas hai
Duniya mein har ilzaam
Ishq mein sab diwaane hain
Ishq mein sab hairaan
Ishq mein sab kuch mushkil
Hai ishq mein sab aasaan
Dekho pyaare ye nazaare
Ye diwaane ye parwaane
Ye ishq mein kaise gum


Haay! Tumse milke dil
Ka hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen
Tumse milke dil ka
Hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen

Dil toh ik raahi jaana
Dil ki tum manzil ho
Dil toh hai ik kashti
Jaana jiska tum saahil ho
Dil na phir kuch maange
Jaana tum agar haasil ho
Dil toh hai mera tanha
Jaana aao toh mehfil ho


Ishq se hi saari khushiyaan
Ishq hi barbaadi
Ishq hai paabandi
Lekin ishq hi azaadi
Ishq ki duniya mein
Yaaron khwaab ki aabaadi
Ho gaya woh jisko
Manzil ishq ye dikhlaadi
Dekho pyaare ye nazaare
Ye diwaane ye parwaane
Ye ishq mein kaise gum


Haay! Tumse milke dil
Ka hai jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa
Ye kamaal kya kahen
Tumse milke dil ka hai
Jo haal kya kahen
Ho gaya hai kaisa ye
Kamaal kya kahen

Tumko puja hai tumhaari
Hi ibaadat kee hai
Hamne jab kee hai toh
Phir aise mohabbat kee hai
Hamne jab kee hai toh
Phir aise mohabbat kee hai
Dil mera paagal hai
Jaana isko tum behlaado
Dil mein kyun halchal hai
Jaana mujhko tum samjhaado
Dil ka jo aanchal hai
Jaana isko tum lehraado
Zulf jo baadal hai jaana
Mujhpe tum barsaado
Jaana leke jaaya hai
Tera ye diwaana
Jaan tujhpe mit jaayega
Tera ye parwaana
Jaana mere dil mein
Kya hai tumne ye na jaana
Jaana tujhko yaad
Aayega mera ye afsaana


Dekho pyaare ye nazaare
Ye diwaane ye parwaane
Ye ishq mein kaise gum


Haay! Tumse milke dil ka

One of the cradles of early civilisations, India has a long and glorious history. Several great kings and dynasties have left an indelible mark, bringing great changes, development and growth.

From the late Bronze Age to the Revolt of 1857 and India's Struggle for Freedom, this compilation gives you a rare glimpse into history. Watch them come alive!

The Tamil Dynasty of the Pandyas, who ruled first from Korkai near present day Tuticorin, before shifting to Madurai, from as early as 600 BC BC had a thriving shipping and trading with Greece and Rome to the Greek and Persian invasions from land and sea. To the massive Chola Empire that spread to the neighbouring countries of South East Asia, The Mauryas in Northern India who conquered most of India except the Tamilians and had great Kings like Chandragupta Maurya and Asoka the Great, The Chera Dynasty from the South, Harshavardhana, The Pallavas, The Rajputs from the Central and North Western India, the Mughals, Sivaji Maharaj and the Marathas, Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan of Mysore and Rani of Jhansi , Laxmibai.

क्यूँ आयेथे मुघल भारत में , जानिये असलीयत इतिहासकी  | History Of India

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother’s side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun’s triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

102 years ago, on this day, the 13th of April, 1919, the joyous festival of Baisakhi turned into a tragic event that shook the nation to its core. Colonel Reginald Edward Harry Dyer, an officer of the British Indian Army, commanded his troops to open fire on a non-violent gathering of unarmed civilians, men, women and children, at the Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar. This came to be known as the Amritsar Massacre, and Dyer himself earned the moniker - The Butcher Of Amritsar.

Many believe that the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre was the beginning of the end of British rule in India, and is remembered as one of the most pivotal moments in the history of Indian Independence. While we may not know the people who sacrificed their lives on this day, we should stand united against the concept of oppression. Watch our small token of tribute to those martyrs who sacrificed their lives and know more about this important event in Indian history.

In today's video, we will see how the first currency note was introduced in India? 
Where was the printing of these currency notes? 
Then how did the arrival of Reserve Bank of India come and what kind of initial notes did they print? See the complete history of Indian currency notes from the beginning to the present day.

When the European companies came to India for business, they established a private bank here for their convenience. And then paper currency started replacing silver and gold currency. And India's first paper currency was issued by the Bank of Hindostan of Calcutta in the year 1770.

In 1861, the then British Government enacted the Paper Currency Act 1861. then they started releasing his paper currency under the Queen Victoria Portrait Series. These paper currency were of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1000 rupees and there was a small picture of Queen Victoria on all these notes. In 1923, a picture of King George 5 was also printed on the Indian paper currency of the British Government.

In 1928, before India's first printing press was set up in Nashik, Maharashtra, all paper currency was printed from the Bank of England. But in the year 1935, the RBI(Reserve Bank of India) was established and in 1938 the British Government gave the Reserve Bank the authority to issue Government of India notes. They printed 10,000 rupee notes, which remained intact till independence. And the first currency note issued by RBI was a 5 rupee note.

मुग़ल साम्राज्य का पूरा इतिहास सिर्फ 17 मिनट में | Mughal Empire History in Hindi | class 7th history


The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur (reigned 1526–1530), a Central Asian ruler who was descended from the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his father's side, and from Genghis Khan on his mother's side. Ousted from his ancestral domains in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.

In this series of UPSC CSE History in 6 Minutes, we will cover the most important history topics for the civil services examination. In today's episode, we are talking about Aryan Civilisation and how our ancestors lived in 1500 BC.

Aryans evolved the Vedic culture from 1500 to 1000 B.C, after the Indus Valley Civilisation - about which we spoke in the previous episode. In the Vedas, the Brahmins speak of their ancestors as the Arya, and of Āryāvarta, the homeland of the Arya.  

In ancient times, the first Aryan population was concentrated in the Northwest. And during the post-Vedic period, Aryavrata extended from Bihar’s Mithila region in the East to Vindhyachal in the South.

273K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
""It is no secret that conquering cultures peg themselves as ‘superior’ and denounce everything that came before them as an ‘age of darkness’. Equally true is the African proverb, “As long as the lions do not have their storytellers, history will always glorify the hunter”.

We Indians know intuitively that the history imposed on us is not our history at all. It is the history of invaders glorifying their invasions. And yet, for over 70 years of independence, we Indians have not managed to cleanse the biases of the colonial imposition of history on us. Sanjeev Sanyal makes a case for telling Indian history the way it happened to us - from the perspective of Indians.


About Speaker: -

Sanjeev is an Indian writer, environmentalist and urbanist, who is considered as one of the world's leading financial sector economists. Sanjeev was the Global Strategist and Managing Director at Deutsche Bank till Oct 2015. He is also the author of three best-selling books, including the ""Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography.""

lnntniGsM24,The Neo-Colonial Mentalities behind the Distortion of Indian History | Ruchir Sharma,"Sangam Talks
273K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Going into the colonial mentalities behind the whitewashing and manipulation of Indian history, Ruchir Sharma discusses how Nehruvians (India's post-colonial Anglophile elite) and their foreign mentors act as the self-appointed gatekeepers of Indian history, culture, and knowledge systems, denying access to the rest of society.
 
They see Indian society with the same lens as our erstwhile colonial masters - not as empowered citizens with reason and intellect, but as violent, savage natives who cannot be trusted with the truth about their own history. Instead of offering an honest conversation through truth and reconciliation, they fabricate narratives designed to degrade and demoralise Indian society and it's indigenous philosophies, ideologies, and political movements.
 
Despite their self-styled branding as Marxist theorists, revolutionary thinkers, or brave dissenters, many of these ""eminent intellectuals"" were simply mentally-colonised elites beholden to foreign political ideologies and co-opted by the Congress establishment to manufacture consent for an increasingly autocratic and dynastic single-party rule with a ""civilising mission"" and ""secularising mission"". 
 
Today, with their domestic political patrons weaker than ever, a new generation of neo-colonial 'comprador' intellectuals are being groomed by foreign intelligence agencies, academics, and NGOs as regime change assets in a long-term endeavour to cripple India's economic and geopolitical aspirations through a Balkanisation strategy.

About the Speaker:

Ruchir Sharma is an award-winning public policy and political advocacy professional with experience in police reform, counterterrorism, and climate change at the intergovernmental level and campaign strategy at the party-level.
 
With an academic background in Marxist theory, the history of terrorism, and Cold War geopolitics, he has also worked as an advisor to a major political party and in recent years, he has been making waves with his piercing articles on history, culture, and international politics, in the Huffington Post, Firstpost, Swarajya, and Russia Insider.

AzJKWgCCPh0,Maharana Pratap's Story that is erased from Indian History | What happend after Haldighati battle?,"Think School
238K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Maharana Pratap was one of the first kings to acknowledge Bharatvarsh and should have been remembered as India's first freedom fighter. But this never happened because post-independence our education system systematically deleted, hid, or undermined the legends of Maharana Pratap Singh, Shri Guru Gobind Singh, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, Bappa Rawal, and many more. 

Maharana Pratap was never captured or defeated by his enemies, he always found a way to survive and fight back. We all know about the Battle of Haldighati, what we are not told know is the resurgence of Maharana Pratap after 1579, and how he gathered an army of 40,000 soldiers and recovered and conquered Gogunda, Kumbhalgarh, Ranthambore, and Udaipur from the Mughals and ruled his land restoring peace and prosperity for the next 18 years. His story is deleted or hidden from our history books but legends never die and his story still lives on the folk songs, regional books, and other documentation from historians outside the country. 

In today’s video, we want to do our part in reviving the real story of Maharana Pratap, the man revered as one of the strongest warriors India has ever seen. Standing at 7 feet 5 inches, he would carry an 80-kilogram spear and two swords weighing around 208 kilograms in total. He would also wear an armor weighing 72 kilograms. Such was his might that once he was faced by Mughal’s biggest fighter Behlol Khan on the battlefield and by just one swing of his Talwar, Khan was split in two along with his Horse.

Maharana was a true patriot who gave up all the royalty and luxury of his crown for the land he so dearly loved. Such was the sacrifice that he chose to eat Rotis made of grass rather than join hands with the Invaders. He respected men and women alike, never discriminated against any race or religion, and always stood for what is right. Such was his ethics and values that even Akbar himself had immense respect for him and cried when he heard about the death of Maharana.
Maharana’s sacrifice and valor will keep inspiring generations of men and women, help us spread the word by sharing this video to celebrate the birthday of Maharana Pratap on 9th May.

Disclaimer : 'Akbar' in the context of Haldighati is a figure of speech and refers to Akbar's army and not Akbar himself.

His participation in the battlefield is still unknown.
While some sources say he did, others say he dint.

Indian war elephants have long captured the popular imagination, in movies and video games alike.  But few have tackled what it was ""really like"" to employ war elephants on the field of battle.

In India, the use of armored war elephants continued through the medieval era, and even into the early modern era.  Was this a foolish strategic decision, or was there still a use for war elephants in a time where the battlefield was dominated by horse archers?

Enjoy!

Classical and Medieval Indian History is a tale of constant flux — but in between the dozens and hundreds of states at play across the peninsula, there are clear trends that arise. Let's take this chapter of history as an opportunity to dig into different types of sources, and try and wrap our heads around a story that doesn't fit neatly into a single chronology.

The Aryan migration theory and the idea that today's Indians are the direct descendants of the Aryans is still a prevalent debate. 
Who were the Aryans?
Where did they come from?
Are today's Indians Aryans?
Well this video goes back into history and explores one of the oldest known people of the world and answers some questions.

**NB - The map of India should include Pakistan as well. Sorry guys, it's a mistake on my part but well, fire up your imaginations and see the boundaries of India extending to include Pakistan as well in the map shown in the vid!**
Looking back at ancient history is not so easy given our limited resources. In this video, I have taken a look at these theories, the Rig Veda, the ancient history of India and tried to put a picture together.

Over the past 70 years, China has gone through five eras under five leaders: Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping. During this time, there have been great political, economic, cultural, and social changes. On the whole, it has been a move away from poverty, with the general trajectory of these 70 years passing through a period of struggle, a period where the brutal Chinese government assault on the protesters shocked the world. Watch this video to understand the History of China how it went from being a Disaster to Economic Power house of the world.

Next week on Desified, Watch how the world's two largest economies have been locked in a bitter trade battle, story and the origin of China–United States trade war and how this trade war has affected the world.

चीन एक ऐसा देश जिसकी पहचान कुछ चेहरों पर ही सिमट कर रह गई है. माओत्से तुंग से लेकर शी जिनपिंग तक चीन को कुछ चेहरे ही चलाते और संभालते दिखाई देते हैं. लेकिन आज दुनिया में सबसे बड़ी शक्ति बनने की कोशिश कर रहा चीन इन्हीं चेहरों के लिए कुछ अजीबो गरीब फैसलों को भी भुगतता रहा है. पिछले 70 सालों में चीन ने दुनिया के सामने जो नीति अपनाई वो नीति इन्हीं चेहरों के आस-पास सिमटी रही थी. कभी इस देश ने एक फैसले के कारण दुनिया का सबसे बड़ा अकाल झेला तो कभी औरतों के मां बनने के अधिकार पर ही कानूनी रूप से रोक लगाई गई. अपने ही लोगों पर गोली चलाने और दुनिया के लिए अपने बाजार को खोल देने वाले चीन की पूरी कहानी देखिए इस वीडियो में

अगले हफ्ते देसीफाइड में हम आपको दिखाएंगे एक ऐसी लड़ाई जिसमें चीन और अमेरिका आपस में लड़ते दिखाई दे रहे हैं. कैसे जिस अमेरिका की मदद से चीन ने अपने बाजारों को दुनिया के लिए खोला था आज उसी अमेरिका के बाजार को चीन खत्म करने की कोशिश कर रहा है. कैसे चीन के कारण बदली है दुनिया की अर्थव्यवस्था दिखाएंगे आपको अगले हफ्ते

She’s probably the most controversial woman in Chinese history – Wu Zetian, who rose from lowly concubine to become the only woman in all Chinese history to dare to take the title “Emperor”

Since her death 1,300 years ago, Wu Zetian has been remembered as a callous tyrant, who brought calamity to China. But now, extraordinary new discoveries are revealing a very different picture of her reign.

As archaeologists investigate hidden tombs, spectacular pagodas, gigantic palaces and priceless treasures from her time, they are uncovering a very different story of China’s female Emperor, her skills and her empire. Wu Zetian’s China was a military, economic and cultural superpower, whose influence stretched from the edge of the Mediterranean to Japan and India.  Recent discoveries reveal the wealth and stability of her reign, and point to her skills as a politician and a leader. But they also provide tantalising new evidence of the cruelty and violence at the heart of her regime.

With hands-on investigations and access to the treasures of Wu Zetian’s time, this film tries to give a definitive answer to the question: was Emperor Wu an evil tyrant or one of the most successful rulers in all Chinese history?

In the last few years, China has raised many problems on the border of India, recently we have not forgotten the incident of Galvan Valley. So today the whole history of Tibet, what was the situation of Tibet from time to time, which countries or kings ruled on Tibet and whether China and Tibet had one civilization or not? Then how did China annex Tibet? you will know all this and much more in this video, stay with us till the end of the video.

And today a peace loving country like Tibet has become the main adversary of China's militarization. The country, which was considered the world's cleanest white and white roof, has now become a garbage dump of Tibet radioactive waste. Due to this, gradually the water of all the rivers whose origin is Tibet is corrupted. These rivers are the aksas, the Indus, the Brahmaputra, the Irawadi and also the rivers that flow to many countries in Southern Asia, including densely populated countries such as India and Bangladesh. The most worrying thing is that not only China, but also many countries in the US and Europe have obtained an exemption by giving foreign currency to China to throw their radio waste into Tibet.

The Opium War started as a dispute over trading rights between China and Great Britain. Regular trade between Europe and the Chinese had been ongoing for centuries. But China's trading restrictions frustrated the British who were eager to supply the Chinese people with the increasingly popular narcotic Opium. Circumventing the government's attempts to ban opium trade by smuggling and bribery, China declared the death sentence on Opium smuggling and refused to compensate British tradesmen for any losses. Furiously, the Brits sent out a fleet to demand compensation and end the Cohong trading monopoly. Fierce battles and attacks on the Chinese coast were followed. Find out all about the First Opium War from Indy in our new episode of Battlefields!

चीन की विशाल दीवार 
चीन की विशाल दीवार मिट्टी और पत्थर से बनी एक किलेनुमा दीवार है जिसे चीन के विभिन्न शाशको द्वारा उत्तरी हमलारो से रक्षा के लिए पांचवी शताबदी ईसा पूर्व से लेकर सोलहवी शताब्दी तक बनवाया गया इसकी विशालता का अंदाजा इसी बात से लगाया जा सकता है की इस मानव निर्मित ढांचे को अंतरिक्ष से भी देखा जा सकता है इस दीवार के हिस्सो /शाखाओ को आपस में जोड़ दिया जाये तो यह अंदाजा लगाया गया है की इस महान विशाल दीवार के निर्मांण कार्य में 20 से 30 लाख लोगो ने अपना जीवन लगा दिया था और इस दीवार पर मिग वंस की सुरक्षा हेतु 10 लाख से अधिक लोग नियुक्त रहते थे।  इस विशाल दीवार की ऊँचाई हर जगह एक जैसी नही है इसकी सबसे ज्यादा ऊंचाई 35 फुट जबकि कुछ जगह तो 8 से 9  फुट ही ऊँचाई है। इस दीवार को चीन के लोग ""वान ली छांग छंग "" कहते है जिसका अर्थ होता है ""चीन की विशाल दीवार ""  

           चीन की महान दीवार हमेशा अजेय नही रह सकी सन 1211 ईस्वी में चंगेज खान ने इस दीवार पर हमला किया था और इसे तोड़ कर चीन में दाखिल हुआ था। चीन की महान दीवार को बनाते समय जो मजदुर काम करते करते कमजोर पड़ जाते थे और उनकी मोत हो जाती थी उन्हें उसी जगह पर दफना दिया जाता था और माना जाता है की इस दीवार को बनाने में लगभग 3000 मजदूरो की जान गई और कैयो ने अपनी पूरी जिंदगी इस दीवार को बंनाने में लगा दी।  इसलिये इस दीवार को लम्बे कब्रिस्तान भी कहा जाता है 

           चीन में राज्य की रक्षा करने के लिए दीवार बनाने की शुरुआत आठवी शताब्दी ईसापूर्व में हुई उस समय कुई , यान और जाहो राज्यो ने तीर और तलवारो से होने वालो आक्रमणों से बचने के लिए मिट्टी और कंकड़ की सहायता से ईंटे बनाई और फिर इन ईटो से दीवार का निर्माण कार्य शुरू किया गया आगे चलकर चिन कीन साम्रज्य के अंतर्गत आ गया और किन साम्रज्य ने सभी छोटे राज्यो को एक एक करके एक अंखड चीन की रचना की और विभिन्न राज्यो द्वारा बनाई गई दीवारों को एक करके विशाल चीन की दीवार का निर्माण किया गया। आज यह दीवार विश्व में चीन का नाम ऊँचा करती है और यूनेस्को द्वारा 1987 में इसे विश्व धरोहर घोषित किया गया। इतना ही नही चीन की इस दीवार को सात अजूबो में भी गिना जाता है।

China: A Century of Humiliation - documentary

This documentary explores the fundamental differences between the Western and Chinese culture from early beginnings. 

The film debates how Christianity and Confucianism were translated in political thought and social systems. 

Next, the film investigates why the industrial revolution did not take place in China, despite its many early inventions, but in Europe. 

China's century of Humiliation sheds light on the first economic and military encounters between the British and Chinese Empires through the eyes of Asian and Western historians. Trade deficits, war threats and reprisals have marked the 19th century as one of the bloodiest and most shameful in Chinese history. 

Today, these past lessons can serve as an powerful insight for what the future might bring for China and the rest of the world.

The invention of script, paper and printing can be credited to the Chinese. It was in China that Cai Lun, in his emperor’s service, made the production of paper suitable for the masses. Originally planned as a means to wrap things in, it soon became obvious that paper was more suitable for writing than the common bamboo stick. Guy will explain, how the Chinese printed written pages long before Gutenberg was born, how Chinese writing actually works and how emperor Qin tried to establish the standardized Chinese Han Characters, or Hanzi, attempting to unify the writing symbols for his country.

History of Chinese Americans in USA (1830s-2000)

This is a poignant and dynamic  story of Chinese immigrants living in the USA between the 1830's and 2000. 

In the early years of the 19th century. many of them were driven out of China by civil wars, floods or famine to seek refuge in America. 

These so-called Chinese Americans have for decades struggled against all odds to live a dissent and respected life in the USA . 

 The host of this program, Bill Moyers, succinctly sums up the story of Chinese 
Americans in these words: 
 ""They have been patronized, welcomed, alleged, despised, excluded, liked, and admired, but have rarely been understood or accepted"". 

At this crucial time of racial unrest in America, it may be fitting to look back in history to see how the Chinese Americans managed to survive blatant racial discrimination in the past 150 years, and emerge a successful visible minority.

But, before we get to the Song, let’s take a tour through the ages and explore key elements of Chinese scientific culture.

A look at the complex political situation on the island of Taiwan. The island of Taiwan is administered by the Republic of China, which lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communists which control the mainland to this day, proclaiming the People's Republic of China in 1949. 

Both the ROC and the PRC claim to be the legitimate government of China. Taiwan is a de facto independent country but is not a member of the United Nations since being replaced in 1971 by the PRC. 

The current situation is stuck in a stalemate with the two ways of resolving the dispute (unification and independence) both seeming very unlikely to happen any time soon.

YEhO7G4W,Superpower Interrupted: The Chinese History of the World,"New America

We in the West routinely ask: ""What does China want?"" The answer is quite simple: the superpower status it always had, but briefly lost. Superpower Interrupted: The Chinese History of the World provides brilliant and unconventional insights for understanding China's ever-evolving role in the world.

As the Chinese see it, for as far back as anyone can remember, China had the richest economy, the strongest military, and the most advanced philosophy, culture, and technology. The collision with the West knocked China's historical narrative off course for the first time, as its 5,000-year reign as an unrivaled superpower came to an ignominious end.

Ever since, the Chinese have licked their wounds and fixated on returning their country to its former greatness, restoring its place in the world as they had always known it. The question was never if they could reclaim their former dominant position in the world, but when.

Join us in conversation with the author of Superpower Interrupted: The Chinese History of the World, Michael Schuman, and New America Cybersecurity Policy Fellow Samm Sacks on July 22 at 12:00pm ET to discuss this colorful, informative story in which we can come to understand how the Chinese view their own history and how its narrative is distinctly different from that of Western civilization.

In which John Green teaches you about the end of World History, and the end of the world as we know it, kind of. For the last hundred years or so, it seemed that one important ingredient for running an economically successful country was a western-style democratic government. All evidence pointed to the idea that capitalist representative democracies made for the best economic outcomes. It turns out that isn't the only way to succeed. In the last 40 years or so, authoritarian capitalism as it's practiced in places like China and Singapore has been working really, really well. John is going to look at these systems and talk about why they work, and he's even going to make a few predictions about the future. Also, thanks for watching this series. It has been amazingly fun to create, and we appreciate all of you.

Qin Shi Huangdi. He is the man who united, and indeed gave China its name. He conquered six powerful warring states and, in 221 BC, declared himself emperor of all China.

During his reign, he introduced sweeping reforms, built a vast network of roads and connected the Great Wall of China which to this day stretches over 2400 kilometers. His legacy not only includes the Great Wall,  but also his astonishing tomb, guarded by the famed Terracotta Army constructed almost 2,200 years ago.

This major drama-documentary offers unprecedented access to new excavations at the major sites, and through major dramatic reconstruction narrates how Ying Zheng became the king of Qin state at 13 and the first Chinese Emperor. It reveals the personality and motivations of this remarkable but still unknown leader.

The Boxer Rebellion was one of China's biggest uprisings against the unwanted European, US-American and Japanese Imperialism. Distrust and tensions marked all contacts with foreigners. Secret societies were formed to propagate against the enemy. The Yihequan, also known as Boxers, quickly rose to one of the biggest organisations in Northern China. Masters of close combat, they mainly targeted converted Chinese Christians and attacks increased wildly in the 1880s. From 1900 Empress Dowager Cixi was less and less opposed to the Rebellion, as she hoped to fight back foreign influence. Shortly after, even the Chinese Army started helping the rebels and foreigners were fought, killed or driven out. Consequently, an alliance of the imperial powers sent in 50.000 soldiers to end the massacre. Tough reprisals and treaties followed. Learn all about the Boxer Rebellion on IT'S HISTORY.

The history of the Forbidden City begins with a bloody coup at the beginning of the 15th century when the ambitious field commander Prince Zhu Di took power. As the Yongle Emperor, he declared Beijing the new capital of China and ordered the construction of a giant palace complex. The building of the architectural symbol of his almightiness, and the perfect reflection of cosmic order, was finished in only a few years. However, Yongle’s destiny was to be intimately tied to the empire’s collapse.

It was the inner sanctum and pulsating heart of the Chinese Empire. Today it is modern China’s greatest tourist attraction: Beijing’s Forbidden City.

This program focuses on the magical site and on two major turning points. The first part, “The Center of the World,” transports us to the reign of Emperor Yongle in the 15th century, the most cosmopolitan period of the Ming Dynasty. Having usurped the throne, Yongle had to rely on his court eunuchs to administer the Empire. Though robbed of their manhood, they rose to occupy the highest posts. This fascinating look at the imperial eunuchs is followed by “The Reign of the Concubine,” which showcases Cixi, the fabled Dowager Empress of the late 19th century.

This week we slow things down to talk about a subject that I'm very passionate about, animation! 

The history of animation in China is a tough subject to study, but it offers great insight into the Chinese culture. It's something quite different from Disney and Studio Ghibli western animation and Japanese anime, and one day soon Chinese animation will be up there along beside them.

Thanks to Carole in Virginia for giving me enough of a push to get this episode finally produced.  This might have been one of the first ten topics I came up with when I began writing the original list back in 2010.

The First Episode of the '20th Century China' series, exploring the evolution of China from empire, to warlord Republic, to Communist state, to modern nation. In this first episode, we look at the events that took place from 1830 to the first decade of the 20th century to understand why and how China's last imperial house, the Qing dynasty, had been weakened enough to eventually fall in 1911. 

We cover topics such as the Boxer rebellion, the Opium Wars, and the social unrest in China that led to popular revolts such as the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom.

China, the middle kingdom, had been one of the mightiest powers of the world for centuries. Their hegemony led to its isolation from most geopolitical developments and world politics. After all, “China lacked no products within its borders”, according to the Qianlong Emperor. When the British Empire demanded trading rights, a contemptuous refusal was all that was given. The Chinese would soon be strong-armed into allowing Western powers to trade on their territory however, and this all happened during two wars that became known as the Opium Wars.

QvGPeezXDIg,Chinese is NOT picture writing! - History of Writing Systems #5 (Determinatives),"NativLang
823K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
Watch this ancient Chinese scribe figure out how to use a fixed set of characters to write limitless words in his language. How? By combining meaning writing (logographs) and sound writing (rebus)!

The result is a set of helpful hints called determinatives, because they help you determine the meaning of a pronunciation character. Determinatives show up in Mayan, Egyptian and other ancient writing systems. In Hanzi (Chinese) and Kanji (Japanese) they're called radicals, simply because they narrow down the root meaning (the ""radix"") of the written character.

While we're visiting China, we'll stumble across an unexpected tension: should writing be easier for the reader to read or for the writer to write?

Oh, and why don't we go a step further? What if we pat Chinese characters on the back, say ""nice try"" and take our scripts ALL THE WAY to pronunciation writing? Tune in next time!

This trade, on the contrary, was not balanced on the side of Britain, as millions of pounds of silver were flowing out of the British Empire and into China, forcing it to seek ways to counter-trade, and then they did: Opium. With the cultivation of opium in British territories in Bengal expanded, Britain started exporting opium from British-controlled India to China.

Opium had been used for medicinal purposes in China for centuries; however, by the early 19th century, the recreational use of opium skyrocketed, followed by an addiction crisis and serious social and economic disruption in China. Under these circumstances, a ban on both the production and the importation of opium was attempted, and smoking opium was outlawed. However, these actions could not halt the opium trade.

By 1836, the Chinese government implemented more serious measures: opium dens were closed and many Chinese dealers were executed. On top of that, on June 3rd 1839, 1,300 metric tons of illegal opium seized from British traders were destroyed at Humen under the aegis of Lin Zexu. The British government was extremely insulted by Lin’s action, and took it as a sign of hostility.
In July, some drunken British sailors brutally murdered a Chinese man, but were not sentenced under the Chinese extradition. In response to this reprehensible incident, Lin halted the British food supply and ordered the Portuguese to expel all British from Macau, forcing them to move to a barren island off the coast (present-day Hong Kong). Taken together, these actions raised the tensions between two sides, and in November 1839, Chinese warships clashed with British merchantmen on the Pearl River estuary in Hong Kong, leading to the outbreak of the First Opium War.

In early 1840, the British government decided to use military force against the Chinese. Their first hostile action was sending warships and merchantmen to Hong Kong, and then proceeding up the Pearl River estuary to Canton. Within the next year, the British forces with its naval and gunnery power inflicted a series of decisive defeats on the Chinese Empire.

After months of negotiations and fighting, in late August, 1942, the British managed to capture Nanking, putting an end to the war with the Treaty of Nanking. The treaty forced China to cede Hong Kong Island to Britain, pay an indemnity of twenty-one million dollars to Britain, and opened five treaty ports at Shanghai, Canton, Ningpo, Fuzhou, and Amoy to British merchants. The supplementary Treaty of the Bogue in 1843 gave ‘most favoured nation status’ to the British Empire and added provisions for British extraterritoriality.

The Second Opium War resulted from the failure of the Nanking Treaty to satisfy British goals of improved trade and diplomatic relations.  In early October 1856, some Chinese marines in Canton seized a British-operated cargo ship Arrow, arresting several Chinese crew members. This incident gave the British the excuse they had been waiting for to use military forces against China once again. But this time, Britain had French support as the murder of a French missionary in China forced France to side with the British.

In early 1858, having already captured Canton, French-British forces headed to Tianjin. Once arriving at Tianjin, a treaty was once again proposed, and unsurprisingly, for the Chinese, it included even more unequal treaties than the last one. The Treaty of Tianjin included the opening of 10 more Chinese ports to foreign trade, permission for foreign legations in Beijing and Christian missionary activity and the legalization of the opium trade.

The humiliating defeat of the Qing army by a relatively small British-French military force was a shocking blow to the once powerful and prosperous Qing Empire. The Opium Wars not only provided convincing evidence of weakened China but also made a further contribution to this weakening. And most importantly, the conflicts were believed to contribute to the ending of the Qing dynasty and also China’s 5,000-year imperial dynastic system, and the beginning of what is now referred to in China as the “Century of Humiliation”.

Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the sources for early Chinese history. The first attempts to make a record of historical events in China date from the Shang dynasty of the second millennium BC. The earliest surviving records were inscribed on bones or tortoise shells; in later centuries, chroniclers left detailed accounts on paper or silk. In the last hundred years, archaeologists have discovered a wealth of new materials, including a cache of previously unknown texts which were found in a sealed cave on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Such sources are are shedding new light on Chinese history, although interpreting ancient sources from the period before the invention of printing presents a number of challenges.

In China, there exists an astonishing place. A burial ground to rival Egypt’s Valley of the Kings, where pyramid tombs of stupendous size are full of astonishing riches. In 221 BC, China's first Emperor united warring kingdoms into a nation that still exists today. To memorialise this achievement, he bankrupted the national treasury and oppressed thousands of workers to build one of the world’s biggest mortuary complexes. China's second dynasty, the Han, inherited the daunting challenge of building larger tombs to command respect and establish their right to rule without running the nation into the ground. Although no Han emperor's tomb has been opened, the tombs of lesser Han aristocrats have revealed astonishing things: complete underground palaces (including kitchens and toilets) and at least one corpse so amazingly well-preserved some believe Han tomb-builders knew how to ""engineer immortality"". But most tombs were robbed, leaving another dynasty hundreds of years later – the brilliant Tang – to lead a revolution in tomb design, tunnelling simple shaft-tombs into natural mountains and filling them with small, inexpensive grave goods that symbolised more than reproduced the perfect afterlife.

OOpxbdqrkk,The Great Wall of China: History And Facts!,"Down The Rabbit Hole
73.9K subscribers
SUBSCRIBE
From how it was built, to the importance of the wall today, join me as we explore facts and historical points about the Great Wall of China!
9. The Great Wall Of China's Popularity
Fun fact, the Great Wall of China originally wasn't one long wall. It actually was sections of wall that were eventually filled in to become one great long wall that we now know of today. Furthermore, the wall that we know of now, isn't the same wall (per se) that was started with. As this wall has been upgraded, remade, rebuilt, and enhanced over the various Chinese dynasties. There was even completely separate great walls that don't exist anymore. But this one does.
Widely hailed as one of the most impressive feats by man, the Chinese initially built the Great Wall of China to help ward of raiders and invaders to the north. As their nation and Empire grew, so did the wall. To the extent that as of now, the wall is over 13,000 miles long. It is so big, that it is one of the few landmarks you can see from outer space.
Naturally, people go to the wall not just for the view, but to walk upon it, and see just how far it truly goes. It's attracted all manner of people from various nations, and even a President from United States in a historic moment.
Millions of people come to see the wall, which isn't too hard when the length of the thing allows you to see it from various places and angles.
8. The Building Of The Wall
So as we teased, the Great Wall of China wasn't just something that was made in one sitting, or even by one group of Chinese people. It's a massive project that took over 1800 years to make in full, with many people coming together one after another to add onto it and more.
Also as noted, this wasn't the first wall that the Chinese built themselves. In fact, throughout the course of Chinese history, you'll find that walls and barriers were the go-to defense mechanism for them to try and defend against the invaders that they knew were coming. This eventually led to the start of the Qin dynasty, ruled over by Qin Shi Huang. He had captured a whole bunch of places within China, and to ensure that he could defend them, he built a 5000 kilometer wall. This was mean to defend his territory as well as keep a lock on what was his. This was the first true part of the Great Wall of China.
But, as I stated, this wasn't the end of it. As more and more dynasties came to be, they kept the wall up, and then added onto it. Sometimes to continue the reach of the wall, and other times to just improve upon it. The Ming Dynasty is one of the dynasties that are most credited with the ""completion"" of the wall. This is because of how the wall looks now and how it is kept together.
Which brings us to the other misconception of the wall. If you look at it from above, the Great Wall of China looks like one long, snaking wall. But that's not exactly true. It's ""interrupted"" by various things, including buildings. It is connected, but it's not like regular border walls where they are a continuous line. Rather, it's a ""network"" that spans 20,000 kilometers and is broken up by buildings, towers, and more that help connect them.
It's still an impressive feat, no doubt. But it's not exactly what everyone says that is. And if you actually look at the shape of the wall, you'll see all the different angles that the wall turns in. A singular wall would be much straighter.
7. The Wall's Construction Force
Given the nature of the Great Wall of China, you would be forgiven for thinking that various townsfolk and soldiers and such were responsible for the bulk of the work. And to an extent, that probably is true, but not unlike many other massive monuments in the world today, back then, the main force of labor...were slaves and criminals. Not unlike the Coliseum of Vespasian where over 10,000 slaves helped build that monument.
But for the Great Wall of China, it was the criminal element that really helped make the wall what it was, including in the days of the Qin dynasty where the wall got started. It was dictated that wall construction, maintenance and surveillance were all punishments to be carried out by criminals. The ironic thing here is that when it came to the various crimes that would have been dealt with via wall duty, it was a very wide net. It didn't matter if you were a murderer, or someone who just didn't pay their taxes on time, you were sent to the wall.
Now to be clear, there were regular builders, workers, and civilians on the walls, so to make sure that everyone knew which was which, all criminals would have their heads shaved, their faces blackened, and would have their limbs put in chains.
You might be thinking, ""Why were they so bent on putting criminals on the wall? Did they not have jails or something?"" That is one way of thinking about it, but what you need to know here is that building the Great Wall of China...

I made this video in a Documentary Production class in Spring 2009; despite the fact that I was learning the ropes of Final Cut Express as I went along, I think the end result turned out very well. I did as much research as I could at the time, which was limited to John Lent's book Animation in Asia and the Pacific, and a few scattered internet sources. I wrote the script over the course of a few days, then borrowed a microphone from the professor and asked a friend to record the voiceover for me--he did a fantastic job! The video is a mixture of DVD rips and footage downloaded from various video sites; the music and sound effects are from the films themselves. 

Even though I was quite happy with the way this project turned out, I didn't get a chance to upload it until now, because for a long time I couldn't figure out the correct way to export it from Final Cut Express. 

As I have shown this film to different people over the years, I have been alerted to several factual errors that I wasn't aware of when I wrote the script; since I produced the whole film from start to finish in about five weeks, I didn't have much time to fact-check myself. For example, I have been told that the year of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai is way off, as well as the year marking the start of the Anti-Rightist Campaign. In addition, I have incorrect release years listed for at least one of the films (The Plank Bridge was actually released in 1988, for instance). 

Nevertheless, I hope this little documentary is still informative and entertaining; enjoy!

China’s Qing dynasty suffered massive defeats and hardships throughout the 19th century. Two Opium Wars, the Taiping Rebellion, the Sino-Japanese war and natural disasters and famine. Surely, this couldn’t go on for much longer? And indeed, it wouldn’t. In 1911, the sequence of events was triggered that would result in the abdication of China’s last emperor and collapse of the Qing dynasty. Many plots had been devised for this to happen - twisted irony has it that it started with an accidental bomb explosion with no master plan at all. And Sun Yat-sen, principal architect of the revolution, was thousands of miles away.

Letterform Lecture, Jun 18, 2019 — Chinese writing is character-based, the one major world script that is neither alphabetic nor syllabic. Over the past two centuries, Chinese script has encountered presumed alphabetic universalism at every turn, whether in the form of Morse Code, Braille, stenography, Linotype, punch cards, word processing, or other systems developed with the Latin alphabet in mind. Today, however, after more than a century of resistance against the alphabetic, not only have Chinese characters prevailed, they form the linguistic substrate of the vibrant world of Chinese information technology. In this talk, Stanford historian Tom Mullaney shows how this unlikely transformation happened, by charting out a fascinating series of experiments, prototypes, failures, and successes in the century-long struggle between Chinese characters and the QWERTY keyboard.

The Qin Dynasty was the China's first empire and unified state. We finally see the nation of China as we know it. Its conquest of the Zhou Dynasty states, beginning in 230 B.C., ended the Warring States Period. Going back a bit, the Qin state, with its capital at Xianyang, was located near modern-day Xi'an, & while they served as a buffer state between the Zhou and other states, they were never really loved by the Zhou. But how did ONE state, Qin, conquer ALL of those other states? A little over a century earlier that the groundwork for conquest was laid by Duke Xiao through the work of Shang Yang, his Chancellor. He is a great representative of Legalism because of two policies: fixing the standards, & treating the people as one. Shang Yang was a reformer and systematically worked the entire social order of Qin, eventually creating a bureaucratic state. He & Duke Xiao advocated for a unified China. 

Among Shang Yang’s innovations was a system to expand the army beyond the nobility, splitting the army into 20 ranks, giving land as a reward to all accomplished soldiers. This created a massive infantry. 
Unpopular policies: 
* Strip the nobility from those who were unwilling to fight. 
* Loyalty to the state over loyalty to the family / clan. 
* Free convicts who cleared land for agriculture
* Enslaved underachieving farmers 
* Partly abolished primogeniture (depending on the son) + doubly taxed households with  more than one son 

Upon the death of Duke Xiao, Shang Yang was charged with treason by the old aristocrats in the state. He fled and eventually attempted to raise his own army…sources say he was either killed in battle…but was executed in 338 B.C. with five chariots pulling him apart. 
 
The conquest began. The states of Shu and Ba (Sichuan) went to war, both begging for Qin’s help. And so it began. 
 
China was now a unified nation for the first time, and based on what we know about what Shang Yang did for the Qin state, we know exactly what’s coming for this new nation of China. Ying Zheng took the name Qin Shi Huang Di (“first emperor of Qin”).

He had won. Now the real work began...China was home to several clashing cultures & languages. So, the Qin standardized the Chinese language! It provided for the first time, a common tongue - & led to the eventual founding of an imperial academy. Also, older philosophical texts were confiscated & restricted. The Qin not only standardized written language, but weights + measures, & currency! It’s debated that the name China comes from the word Qin.

The Qin didn’t stop at standardizing, but also built over 4,000 miles of roads & “the straight road”, a 500 mile highway that transported materials to the Great Wall! 

Nothing made Qin Shi Huang happier than celebrating his new dynasty. When he conquered someone, a replica of that state’s palace was constructed across from Qin Shi Huang’s Palace along the Wei River. Those palaces were connected & populated by singing girls from the conquered states. Weapons from Qin conquests were collected & melted down to be used for casting giant statues in Xianyang. 

Advised by the sorcerer Lu Sheng, he traveled in secret via tunnels and lived in secret locales. Citizens couldn't use the emperor’s personal name in documents, & anyone who revealed his location would be executed. Remember the movie Hero? Yeah, that emperor.

His famous achievement was the 700,000 workers sent to the Lishan Mountains to build his tomb. What’s now known as the Terracotta Warriors site was designed as an underground city that Qin Shi Huang would rule in the afterlife. This complex contained temples, chambers and halls, buildings, sculptures, animals, and replicas of the imperial armory, acrobats, officials, & more!

Outside the east gate, Qin Shi Huang created his army — almost 8,000 terracotta warriors, 600 terracotta horses, plus chariots, stables & other artifacts. We’d love to excavate to learn more, but it’s been delayed due to the site's mercury levels and cave-in concerns.

Qin Shi Huang died while on a tour. His officials wanted to keep it secret, so they filled up 10 carts with fish to travel with his body. They also forged a letter from Qin Shi Huang to crown prince Fu Su, ordering his suicide, which he did, allowing the officials to establish Qin Shi Huang’s younger son as emperor. 

Shortly after his death, most of the Qin’s empire revolted against the new emperor. Before long, a Warlord named Xiang Yu defeated the Qin army in battle, executed Fu Su, destroyed the capital & split up the empire into 18 states.

A new guy - Liu Bang, ruler of the Han River Valley, rose up against other local kings & then spent three years revolting against Xiang Yu. Now it's 202 B.C., & Xiang Yu’s getting pretty bummed out. He commits suicide, & Liu Bang assumes the title of emperor of the Han Dynasty.

For little under fourteen years, the Taiping Rebellion waged over China. Seventeen provinces were ravished and the estimated loss of life is between 20 and 25 million. It is the deadliest civil war, one of the deadliest wars ever, and the largest conflict of the 19th century. The Qing dynasty, however, was not only faced with the Taiping rebellion during this time but with several other (the Panthay, Dungan and Nian rebellion) rebellions throughout the country and the second opium war. It is one of the bloodiest episodes in Chinese history, which…really says something. and it raises an interesting question, how did the Qing manage to stay in power during this carnage?

About the 'End of Empire' series: 

China's Qing Dynasty was faced with internal rebellions, widespread corruption and natural disasters throughout the 19th century. Furthermore, it suffered humiliating defeats at the hands of Western powers and Japan. It makes one wonder how the Qing Dynasty managed to stay in power during this time. The Taiping rebellion will be the start of this series about the downfall of the Qing Dynasty. Over the course of several weeks, I will delve into the major events that happened in China from 1850 to 1911 and attempt to understand and shed light on the last death throes of the once mighty Qing dynasty.

_8s3fz3rN,Klaus Mühlhahn On China's Rise In A Historical Perspective,"USC U.S.-China Institute
10.3K subscribers

Many commentators claim that China's ongoing global rise reflects a restoration of its earlier international prominence, while others highlight that China's emergence reflects distinctive characteristics of the country's current political leadership. In his new book, Making China Modern, Klaus Mühlhahn of the Free University of Berlin provides a panoramic survey of China's rise and resilience through war and rebellion, disease and famine. At this event Professor Mühlhahn will focus on the lessons from history that provide insight into China's evolving international position and how the United States and others should respond.

About the Book

A panoramic survey of China’s rise and resilience through war and rebellion, disease and famine, that rewrites China’s history for a new generation.

It is tempting to attribute China’s recent ascendance to changes in political leadership and economic policy. Making China Modern teaches otherwise. Moving beyond the standard framework of Cold War competition and national resurgence, Klaus Mühlhahn situates twenty-first-century China in the nation’s long history of creative adaptation.

In the mid-eighteenth century, when the Qing Empire reached the height of its power, China dominated a third of the world’s population and managed its largest economy. But as the Opium Wars threatened the nation’s sovereignty from without and the Taiping Rebellion ripped apart its social fabric from within, China found itself verging on free fall. A network of family relations, economic interdependence, institutional innovation, and structures of governance allowed citizens to regain their footing in a convulsing world. In China’s drive to reclaim regional centrality, its leaders looked outward as well as inward, at industrial developments and international markets offering new ways to thrive.

This dynamic legacy of overcoming adversity and weakness is apparent today in China’s triumphs―but also in its most worrisome trends. Telling a story of crisis and recovery, Making China Modern explores the versatility and resourcefulness that matters most to China’s survival, and to its future possibilities.

About the Speaker

Klaus Mühlhahn is Professor of Chinese History and Culture and Vice President at the Freie Universität Berlin. His book ""Criminal Justice in China: A History"" won the John K. Fairbank Prize in East Asian History from the American Historical Association. Mühlhahn has published widely on modern Chinese history in English, German, and Chinese and is a frequent commentator on China for the German media.

he history of the world (or world history) describes the history of humanity (or human history) as determined by the study of archaeological and written records. Ancient recorded history begins with the invention of writing. However, the roots of civilization reach back to the earliest introduction of primitive technology and culture. Prehistory begins in the Paleolithic Era, or ""Early Stone Age,"" which is followed by the Neolithic Era, or New Stone Age, and the Agricultural Revolution (between 8000 and 5000 BCE) in the Fertile Crescent. The latter period marked a change in human history, as humans began the systematic husbandry of plants and animals. Agriculture advanced, and most humans transitioned from a nomadic to a settled lifestyle as farmers in permanent settlements. Nomadism continued in some locations, especially in isolated regions with few domesticable plant species; but the relative security and increased productivity provided by farming allowed human communities to expand into increasingly larger units, fostered by advances in transportation.
As farming developed, grain agriculture became more sophisticated and prompted a division of labour to store food between growing seasons. Labour divisions then led to the rise of a leisured upper class and the development of cities. The growing complexity of human societies necessitated systems of writing and accounting. Many cities developed on the banks of lakes and rivers; as early as 3000 BCE some of the first prominent, well-developed settlements had arisen in Mesopotamia (""the Land between the Rivers""), on the banks of Egypt's Nile River, in the Indus River valley, and along the major rivers of China.
The history of the Old World (particularly Europe and the Mediterranean) is commonly divided into ancient history (or ""Antiquity""), up to 476 CE; the Postclassical Era (or ""Middle Ages""), from the 5th through 15th centuries, including the Islamic Golden Age (c. 750 CE – c. 1258 CE) and the early Italian Renaissance (beginning around 1300 CE); the Early Modern period, from the 15th century to the late 18th, including the Age of Enlightenment; and the Late Modern period, from the Industrial Revolution to the present, including contemporary history.
In the mid-15th century, the invention of modern printing, employing movable type, revolutionized communication, helping end the Middle Ages and ushering in the Scientific Revolution. By the 18th century, the accumulation of knowledge and technology, especially in Europe, had reached a critical mass that brought about the Industrial Revolution. Outside the Old World, including ancient China and ancient India, historical timelines unfolded differently. However, by the 18th century, due to extensive world trade and colonization, the histories of most civilizations had become substantially intertwined (see Globalization). In the last quarter-millennium, the rates of growth of population, knowledge, technology, commerce, weapons destructiveness, and environmental degradation have greatly accelerated, creating opportunities and perils that now confront the planet's human communities.

Greeks Romans Vikings The Founders Of Europe - Episode 1: The Greeks - History Documentary HD. Ancient Greece, the cradle of modern Europe. Around 3000 years ago, the cultural foundations of western civilisation were laid right here, on the shores of the Mediterranean. It’s the birthplace of democracy, where great thinkers forged the beginnings of scientific reasoning, where theatre was turned into mass entertainment, and where the Olympic Games began. Imaginative animation, stunning visuals and an entertaining narrative combine in an extraordinary exploration of Greece and the rise of an ancient super-power that would leave a permanent mark on society. Good SBS documentary, from Germany, in German & Greek. Please be merciful with the parts where Greeks (who don't really look like Greeks but rather like Middle Easterns) speak German...   :)
........................................................
The legacy of the Greeks is under assault today thus deserves defence and celebration for the simple reason that much of what we are is the result of that brilliant examination of human life first begun by the Greeks; as Jacob Burckhardt says, ""We see with the eyes of the Greeks and use their phrases when we speak."" We must listen to the Greeks not because they will give us answers, but because they first identified the questions and problems, and they knew too where the answers must come from: the minds of free human beings who have control over their own lives. And this, finally, is the greatest good we have received from the Greeks: the gift of freedom.

The Greeks are accused by some of stealing their achievements from Egyptians and Babylonians, of oppressing their wives and daughters, and of hypocritically speculating about freedom while holding slaves. And that is the greatest irony: the spirit of criticism that among so many academics has fossilized into a pose has its origins nowhere but among the Greeks, who were the first to question critically everything from the gods to political power to their very selves, the first to live what Socrates called “the examined life”. 
As Victor Hanson and John Heath write, “Not one of the multicultural classicists really wishes to live under indigenous pre–Colombian ideas of government, Arabic protocols for female behaviour, Chinese canons of medical ethics, Islamic traditions of church and state, African approaches to science, Japanese ideas of race, Indian social castes, or Native American notions of private property.” 
Classic Greek culture has come under attack precisely because its achievement, extended into history, is what defines the West and makes it distinct. What is valuable in the much abused Western tradition, hence the examined life, the pursuit of truth, the dialogue about the place of the individual in the larger group, comes from the Greeks. Humanism, reason, the pursuit of knowledge and the arts, moderation and civic responsibility, all come from the Greeks. 
The failings of the Greeks, including not living up to their own ideals, are the failings of humanity everywhere. But their ideals, still alive today, led to the recognition of a common humanity that was more important than gender or social status, more profound than local or tribal affiliations. Without this insight, slavery might never have been abolished in the West, women might never have been granted equality, and the liberal notion that all humans possess innate rights merely as a virtue of being human would never have existed. 

(Bruce Thornton, “Greek Ways: How the Greeks Created Western Civilization”, 2002, ""Defending the Greeks"", Private Papers, 2005,  Victor Davis Hanson, John Heath, “Who Killed Homer: The Demise of Classical Education and the Recovery of Greek Wisdom, 1998”)

The Renaissance was a cultural revitalization that spread across Europe, and had repercussions across the globe, but one smallish city-state in Italy was in many ways the epicenter of the thing. Florence, or as Italians might say, Firenze, was the home to a seemingly inordinate amount of the art, architecture, literature, and cultural output of the Renaissance. Artists like Michelangelo, Leonardo daVinci, Sandro Boticelli, and many others were associated with the city, and the money of patrons like the Medici family made a lot of the art possible. Today you'll learn about how the Renaissance came to be, and what impact it had on Europe and the world.

Only a couple of decades after the end of the First World War--which was supposed to be the War that Ended All Wars--another, bigger, farther-flung, more destructive, and deadlier war began. Today, you'll learn about how the war in Europe progressed, from the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the invasion of Poland, to the Western and Eastern fronts, to VE Day and the atom bombs used in Japan.

When the Protestant Reformation broke out in Western Europe, the Catholic Church got the message, at least a little bit. Pope Paul III called a council to look into reforming some aspects of the Catholic Church and try to stem the tide of competing Christian sects popping up all over the place. The Council of Trent changed some aspects of the organization, but doubled down on a lot  of the practices that Martin Luther and other reformers had a problem with. Today you'll learn about the Council of Trent, the rise of the Jesuits, and Saint Teresa of Avila.

The end of the Napoleonic Wars left the great powers of Europe shaken. Judging from the destruction that had been wrought across the continent, it seemed to the powers that be that the Enlightenment had liberated the people, and led to disaster. So, everybody got together in Vienna to have a Congress, and to try to put Europe ""right"" again. By ""right"" I mean they wanted to go back to the old days of kings, queens, and nobles running the show. But this new yearning for the past pervaded the continent. Roomanticism arose at the same time, looking back at (imagined) golden age of Medieval Times. Today we'll talk about the Congress of Vienna, The Holy Alliance, and the Romantic movement across the arts.

The history of Europe covers the peoples inhabiting Europe from prehistory to the present. The period known as classical antiquity began with the emergence of the city-states of ancient Greece. Later, the Roman Empire came to dominate the entire Mediterranean basin. The fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the Middle Ages. Beginning in the 14th century a Renaissance of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the Protestant Reformation set up Protestant churches primarily in Germany, Scandinavia and England. After 1800, the Industrial Revolution brought prosperity to Britain and Western Europe. The main powers set up colonies in most of the Americas and Africa, and parts of Asia. In the 20th century, World War I and World War II resulted in massive numbers of deaths.

What happened to the Old European? Meaning the original people groups of Europe that inhabited the landmass before the arrival of the Indo-Europeans, a group which would later evolve into the vast majority of European nations we see today, from the Russians, Italians, Irish, Norwegians and Greeks.

Although precious little is known, there are clues left behind in the archaeology, genetics, linguistics and historical texts that have been passed down through the generations, which gives us a somewhat fuzzy picture of pre-historic Europe. Be sure to let me know your thoughts on the pre-Indo-European Europeans and let me know which culture you think is the most interesting. Thanks for watching!

In the aftermath of the revolutions and upheaval in 18th and early 19th century Europe, there was a hunger for reform across the continent. Reformers like Robert Owen, Charles Fourier, and Auguste Comte proposed radical new ideas, and at the same time, regular people began to stand up and ask for greater equality, and a louder voice in how they were governed. Results were mixed, but a lot of the ideas that emerged during this time are still echoing in our world today.

The traditional European powers were greatly weakened by years of total war and widespread destruction. The USSR was looking to expand its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, and at the same time, the United States was assisting with the rebuilding of Western Europe (with some hegemonic strings attached).

European exploration had a lot of side effects. When the Old World and the New World began to interact, people, wealth, food, animals, and disease began to flow in both directions. In the New World, countless millions were killed by smallpox, measles, and other Old World diseases. Old World animals changed life in the New World irrevocably, and the extraction of wealth and resources from the Americas ultimately contributed to the development of the Atlantic Slave Trade. So, it was an exchange with a lot of downside, especially for non-Europeans.

The thing about European History is that it tends to leak out of Europe. Europeans haven't been great at staying put in Europe. As human beings do, the people of Europe were very busy traveling around to trade, to spread religion, and in a lot of cases to try and conquer other people. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Europeans developed a bunch of tools and techniques that would allow them to travel around the world, in numbers and force heretofore unseen on the planet. And a lot of the results weren't great for the people who already lived in the places Europeans were ""visiting.""

World War I was a total war for millions of people in Europe. Many men were enlisted in the fighting, but the war work had implications for the daily lives of a huge number of Europeans. Women entered the workforce in huge numbers, and for a lot of people, the battles raged through their towns, cities, and even their homes. 

In addition to learning about the homefronts of the war, we're going to look at how the war ended, and how the Paris Peace Conference and the treaties that resulted did little to heal the societal wounds of the war, and in many ways set the stage for the next big war.

So, ""modern"" is kind of a loaded term, but today we're going to talk about modern life in Europe, as it looked around the time the 19th century turned into the 20th. We'll look at what life was like in the rapidly growing urban centers of Europe, how developments in communication and information distribution influenced the way people saw their leaders and their neighbors, and how women began making strides toward equality in this era.

Today we'll talk about how the French Revolution unfolded, and what (if anything) was really accomplished. You'll learn about stuff like the National Assembly, the Tennis Court Oath, the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, the guillotine, Robespierre, and a bunch of other kind of unbelievable details.

Europe's system of alliances and centuries-old tensions erupted into war in August of 1914. This week on Crash Course Euro, we're talking about the military history of World War I, and taking a look at the broad strokes of how the war unfolded. We'll take you from the guns of August through gruesome battles like Verdun and the Somme, and follow the thread all the way through to the Armistice in 1918. It didn't turn out to be the War to End All Wars, sadly, but there is a lot to learn from it.

During World War II, Nazi Germany undertook the imprisonment and summary execution of many of its own citizens, and citizens of the nations they occupied. One of the groups that came under assault was the European Jewish population. More than six million Jewish people were killed in a systematized genocide. Five million more people died in the same time frame as a result of Nazi persecution. In addition to the Jews, Roma people, homosexuals, political dissidents, Polish people, Slavic people, black people, and many other perceived enemies were imprisoned and killed by the regime.

First #European contacts. In 1497, the Portuguese king Manuel I sent the navigator Vasco da Gama to find a sea route to India via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. Da Gama reached the port of Calicut on the Malabar coast on June 18, 1498, and his fleet returned to Lisbon, Portugal, in 1499. The Venetians were Europe's main traders in Asian spices, which they bought in Egypt.The Portuguese set up a trading empire in the Indian Ocean, capturing and fortifying all the leading trading ports. They controlled the major sea routes between India, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The Portuguese made Goa their capital in India. The city became an important European settlement. The Portuguese supremacy in the Indian Ocean lasted for just over a hundred years. East India companies. The British East India Company was founded in 1600. The Dutch East India Company was formally incorporated two years later, although the Dutch merchants of Amsterdam had been trading in the Indian Ocean as early as 1595. The arrival of the British and the Dutch in India was unwelcome to the Portuguese, who tried to keep control of the Asian trade. The British East India Company, by contrast, was much weaker. In the 1600's it acquired three independent sovereign settlements in India, Madras (now Chennai), Bombay (now Mumbai), and Calcutta (now Kolkata), and each grew into substantial trading ports. The ports were all fortified with sea walls and cannon. The British company, like the Dutch, raised a small army of professional soldiers. After 1700, the British East India Company was strong enough to equip a large number of well-armed ships for trading in the Indian Ocean. Rivalry between Britain and France. In the 1720's the French government granted a charter to a French East India Company to trade with India. The French made their headquarters at Pondicherry in southern

In many ways, this collapse is still playing out today. In this video you'll learn how countries like Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Poland and many others moved into the post-Soviet world.

You may have noticed that the internet is terrible at religious discourse. Well, this is not a new phenomenon. In the early 16th century, the Roman Catholic church dominated Christianity in Europe, and the institution was starting to show some cracks. Tensions mounted and protests grew, and eventually, the Protestant Reformation happened. Martin Luther nailed his 95 Theses to the church door in Wittenberg, but the Reformation doesn't exactly begin with Luther, and it certainly doesn't end with him. Today, we're looking at how and why the Catholic church in Europe split, first into two sects, and eventually into a LOT of sects.

The past four centuries have seen great changes in the size and composition countries in Europe and the surrounding area. This data series focuses on what the largest polities were throughout recent history. Given the challenges of demography, the visualization begins in 1600 and details the numerous changes to population within the interim period. Europe today has eight times the amount of people it did just 400 years ago.

A wide variety of sources were employed in order to project the data. Tacitus.nu, Penguin Atlas of Recent History, various academic studies, and Eurostat provided most of the information. The population of colonies and holdings outside of Europe are excluded with the exception of the Russian and Ottoman Empires. Given the numerous changes in borders, the continental total can sometimes be erratic, shifting downwards or upwards for seemingly no reason. Generally, this is because various other nations are either no longer being recorded or diverging sources, not necessarily due to massive casualties. Examples include after the fall of the Soviet Union, where many former Soviet Republics are no longer included in the total, and the decline of the Ottoman Empire, with the loss of Egypt and North Africa. I've attempted to include as many states as possible, though there are a few excluded during portions of the presentation due to logistical difficulties. Obviously no data set is perfect, especially on matters so speculative such as population growth in the 1600s and 1700s, but I have put in my best effort. Please comment if you notice any serious errors so they can be rectified.

As you grow to understand the living context of European history, you appreciate the great transforming themes embodied by the people who populate this fascinating march.

The two most important themes are the movement toward democracy—culminating in the French Revolution—that dominated the first of the two centuries covered, and the Industrial Revolution with the explosion of science and technology that dominated the second.

Sitting in the beautiful Verdon Gorge in Southern France, I muse on the first European peoples that inhabited that region. People like Cheddar Man from Somerset in England. I consider the cave art of Lascaux, Pech Merle, Niaux, Chauvet, Cougnac etc. The animals depicted there must have been sacred to our ancestors, whether Homo Sapien or Neanderthal, who depended on their meat to survive. 
I include some nice shots of Wisent (European Bison), Griffon vultures and Alpine Chamois (not Ibex as I thought at the time), which are all animals our European ancestors were familiar with. I also explain the genetic origin of European people including the Yamnaya, the hunter-gatherers and the early Neolithic farmers from the Near East.

This course seeks to locate the fundamental transformation of European society and politics during the period under review. We begin with revolutionary Europe when the ancien regime gave way to a society of property owners; politics was divided over a wide spectrum into Conservatism, Liberalism, Radicalism, Democracy, Socialism, Communism and Fascism. 
The great events of ‘the long nineteenth century’ - French Revolution, Napoleonic wars and reorganization, the return of conservatism in 1815, the Reform Bill of 1832, the revolutions of 1830 and 1848, triumphs and tribulations of nationalism and the first and second industrial revolutions- are sought to be integrated and presented with a narrative cohesion. Revolution is a theme that runs through politics for the entire period though their ideological ramifications might have changed.
The century ended in the conflagration of the First World War. Nationalism, capitalism, imperialism and different kinds of revolutionary movements--all played a role. Hobsbawm’s ‘age of catastrophe’ (1914-1945) experienced an elusive quest for peace, the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, rise of Fascism in Italy and emergence of Nazism in Germany. This resulted in a more devastating war. The course seeks to present the background to the emergence of the contemporary world.

SUBSCRIBE
When The Moors Ruled In Europe is a documentary movie presented by the English historian Bettany Hughes. It is a series on the contribution the Moors made to Europe during their 700-year reign in Spain and Portugal ending in the 15th century. It was first broadcast on Channel 4 Saturday 5 November 2005 and was filmed in the Spanish region of Andalusia, mostly in the cities of Granada, Cordoba and the Moroccan city of Fes.

The era ended with the Reconquista during which the Catholic authorities burnt over 1,000,000 Arabic texts.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Join British historian Bettany Hughes as she examines a long-buried chapter of European history--the rise and fall of Islamic culture in what is now Spain and Portugal.

Although generations of Spanish rulers have tried to expunge this era from the historical record, recent archeology and scholarship now shed fresh light on the Moors who flourished in Al-Andalus for more than 700 years.

This fascinating documentary explodes old stereotypes and offers shocking new insights. You’ll discover the ingenious mathematics behind Granada’s dazzling Alhambra Palace, trace El Cid’s lineage to his Moorish roots, and learn how the Iberian population willingly converted to Islam in droves.

Through interviews with noted scholars, you’ll see how Moorish advances in mathematics, astronomy, art, and agriculture helped propel the West out of the Dark Ages and into the Renaissance. What emerges is a richly detailed portrait of a sensuous, inquisitive, and remarkably progressive Islamic culture in Christian Europe.

NEW VIDEO: History of East Asia Agario Style: https://youtu.be/S1z_IVXwwLQ

Animation of the major events between European countries from 1000 until 2020. The text frame on the left shows important events, and the text frame in the top-right shows general trends of the era.

First of all, this video is a SUMMARY of the events in the last millennium. Of course I couldn't add every important event that occurred, and neither could I fit every state to appear at the right moment in time. This involves the countries of Switzerland, Luxembourg and Albania, which I couldn't fit until the end of WW2. Also I couldn't fit the European micro-states, the Baltic states from 1918-1940 and the help of Canadians and others, during WW2.

The size of the countryball corresponds to the country's relative size, economic power, military power, population, and influence in European politics. However, the main goal of the video is not to visualize the relative power of the European states, but it is to provide a concise overview of the events and wars that occurred and the International relations between the states.

The video was made using Adobe After Effects and with the help of lots of historical internet sources.

Music: ""An der schönen blauen Donau"", Op. 314, a waltz by the Austrian composer Johann Strauss II, composed in 1866.

In which John Green teaches you about the European Renaissance. European learning changed the world in the 15th and 16th century, but was it a cultural revolution, or an evolution? We'd argue that any cultural shift that occurs over a couple of hundred years isn't too overwhelming to the people who live through it. In retrospect though, the cultural bloom in Europe during this time was pretty impressive. In addition to investigating what caused the Renaissance and who benefitted from the changes that occurred, John will tell you just how the Ninja Turtles got mixed up in all this.

The Normans in European History - audiobook
Charles Homer HASKINS (1870 - 1937)
Wherever their ships took them, the Normans (Northman) were ruthless conquerors but gifted governors. These eight lectures, given in Boston in 1915 by the eminent Harvard medievalist, Charles Homer Haskins, chronicle the achievements of these descendants of the Vikings, whose genius for assimilation transformed them into French, English, and Sicilian citizens of well-run states. Haskins discusses the great William the Conqueror and Henry II, the impetuous Richard the Lion-Hearted, and the hapless King John. The Normans founded the Kingdom of Sicily in which there was religious toleration and a Saracen bureaucracy, and left us a moving picture of themselves in the Bayeux Tapestry.

LYRICS: 
Let's learn European History
I think I will give it a shot
In the 15th century we have the new Monarchies
exploration and the Renaissance

Let's move onto the 1500s 
Baroque art and the Reformation 
Northern Renaissance continues exploration gets more views
And let's not forget the Wars of Religion 

Europe had a crazy sweet 16 (hundreds) 
The Scientists had a ball 
People still still loved to explore and fight their religious wars and promoted
Absolut- and constitutional ism 

17 to 1789 
Philosophes enlightened their minds
Agriculture & industry changed but absolutism stayed the same 
Rococo was cool at the time 

89 to 1815
The French revolted. It was massive 
Napoleon went a little cray, Europe tried to make him go away 
And the art was neoclassic

1814 - 1914 
Will take 3 verses to explain 
We were reformin', revoltin' and reactin 
Industrial Revolution was a bit of a pain 

National and imperial,
The ""isms"" were really real  
Consolidating bigger states, La Belle Epoque before the hate
The Great War was coming, which they could feel 

The Art right now had mood swings 
From Real they moved to first Impressions
Post-Impressionism was a creative name, Expressed feelings that weren't lame 
Cubism was last in the progression

1914 WWI arrived 
Ended with Versailles
Between the wars totalitarian 
took over the government 
Hitler preached things that were lies. 

World War II appeared in 1939
The years it lasted were 6
Cold war came along, 
people messed with nuclear bombs, 
and colonies sure didn't stick 

Now Europe's cool enough to be modern 
Communism got shut down 
The Euro united a lot of them. 
Fauvism then Surrealism. 
and we've been brought up to now.
AP Euro, AP Euro...
why did you take AP?You must be crazy, I'm so sorry, at least your in the same boat as me.

5CpTdZdHVY,Proto-Indo-European Origins | DNA,"Study of Antiquity and the Middle Ages
122K subscribers

The origins of modern Europeans are shrouded in mystery and wracked by controversy. Archaeologists and linguists have long debated the origins of the Indo-European language family as well as the origins of civilization and settled life in Europe. Recent discoveries in past years suggest that the origin of European culture, as well as some central Asian cultures, is within an archaeological culture called the Yamnaya.

One major source of contention over the origins of the precursor to modern European cultures is over whether they involved the movement of actual people or merely the exchange of ideas. Before about 9,000 BP Europe was still in the Palaeolithic. It was populated largely by hunter-gatherers, living not very differently from how they had lived when they first arrived in Europe roughly 37,000 years ago.

Beginning around 9,000 BP however, agriculture and village life began to spread across Europe and by 5,000 BP the continent was mostly settled by Neolithic farmers. Around 5,000 BP or 3,000 BC a Bronze Age culture began to spread across Europe, probably from the steppes of Eurasia.

In one view, this change is related to trade networks that existed across Eurasia. People of Europe were in trade contact with the people of the Middle East and the Eurasian steppes and they adopted the technology and lifeways of more technologically advanced outsiders.

The original position of many European archaeologists, however, was that the second instance, at least, represented an invasion. In 3,000 BC, nomadic pastoralists from the steppes of Eurasia replaced and interbred with the Neolithic farmers who had settled Europe about 4,000 years earlier.

More recent views also contend that Neolithic farmers from Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) began to spread across Europe around 7,000 BC without much interbreeding with the native hunter-gatherers. This suggests that both may have been the result of actual migrations of people.

Although there are still many unanswered questions, sequencing of ancient human genomes has revealed that these culture changes in Europe were partially the result of a migration of people.
The earlier migration of farmers from Anatolia is beyond the scope of this article, but recent research suggests that the dawn of Bronze Age Europe was due to the expansion of the Yamnaya culture.

Was Napoleon the greatest conqueror ever? What do we know about him? 
He was the man who established the First French Empire. To the French people he was a hero. To the French royalty he was their demise. Napoleon Bonaparte was a scourge to European leaders, but the countries he conquered joined a vast empire spanning from Spain into Russia. 
Along with his control over Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte conquered territories in the West Indies, Americas, and Northern Africa. Napoleon may have been the greatest conqueror history has ever seen.
Napoleon Bonaparte was born on August 15, 1769 on Corsica, an island in the Mediterranean Sea. Just before his birth the island of Corsica was conquered by French forces, making baby Napoleon and his family subjects of King Louis XV.

In this AP Daily: Live Review session for AP European History, we will examine the historical developments that led to the struggle for sovereignty within and among states that resulted in varying degrees of political centralization. 

We will explore how absolutist forms of rule affected social and political development of the time, and how challenges to absolutism resulted in alternative political systems in parts of Europe.

Our skill development will focus on writing a contextualization paragraph and making a historically defensible thesis/claim. We will share strategies that help students construct thoughtful responses that address the Contextualization and Thesis criteria on the AP Exam; and we will provide viewers with a chance to practice their skills through a choice of a long essay question (LEQ) prompt, or a document-based question (DBQ) prompt.

Enjoy!

7000 BCE onwards - Proto-Indo-Europeans are believed to have spoken a language ancestral to over four hundred languages of the modern world.  Why do we believe this when there is no firm evidence of a Proto-Indo-European language though?

In the new data-driven era, data visualisation is emerging as a critical asset and an essential tool that allows people to grasp vast amounts of data at the glimpse of an eye. As such, it has transformed the way data is accessed, presented and used.

Governmental authorities all over the world are discovering the value of sharing more structured machine readable data with the general public. And during the ongoing pandemic the open governmental data has become even more important than is was before.

In the past few months journalists and media organisations have been reporting on Coronavirus around the clock, e.g. how governmental action has impacted the spread of the disease Covid-19. To do this timely and in a way that appeals to a large audience – and one which is also willing to pay for content – media organisations and journalists have turned to structured machine readable data provided by third parties. This allows them to create great content under tight time restraints.

Some governmental authorities, however, have over the past 12 months done a better job in data accessibility than others. This session will highlight good and bad examples of data repositories and workout a set of guidelines consisting of nine recommendations for data sharing policies by governmental bodies.

About the speaker: Barnaby Skinner, 46, has a degree in Modern European History from the University of Basel, where he focused on the history as technology. As a journalist he has shifted his focus to digital transformation. He heads the Visuals department – consisting of information designers, software developers and data journalists – at the Swiss daily newspaper «Neue Zürcher Zeitung».
